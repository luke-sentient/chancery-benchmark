own any share of stock of the Corporation (a) on which it has the right to

acquire either immediately or at some future date pursuant to any agreement,

or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise, or

deemed owned through application of the foregoing clause (a) of this Section

(3)), by any other corporation, person or other entity either with which it or

its affiliate or associate has any agreement, arrangement or understanding

successor provision. Also for purposes of this Article Nine, the outstanding

shares of any class of stock of the Corporation shall include shares deemed

shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of

directors, and (ii) any corporation, person or other entity is an affiliate

or associate of another. Any such determination made in good faith shall be

conclusive and binding for all purposes of this Article Nine.



(4) No amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall

amend, alter, change or repeal any of the provisions of this Article Nine

unless the amendment effecting such amendment, alteration, change or repeal

shall receive the affirmative vote of eighty percent (80%) of all classes of

stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors,

considered for the purposes of this Article Nine as one class.

ARTICLE IV



The number of directors shall be fixed in the Bylaws or, in the absence of a

Bylaw fixing the number, the number shall be three.



ARTICLE V



(1) To the full extent that the VSCA, as it exists on that date hereof, or as

hereafter amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of

Directors and officers, no Director or officer of the Corporation made a party

to any proceeding shall be liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for

monetary damages arising out of any transaction, occurrence or course of

conduct, whether occurring prior or subsequent to the effective date of this

Article V.



(2) To the full extent permitted by the VSCA as it exists on the date hereof,

or as hereafter amended, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who is or

was a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that (a) he or she is or

was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or (b) he or she is or was

serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, trustee, partner or

officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee

benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability incurred by him or her

in connection with such proceeding. A person is considered to be serving an

employee benefit plan at the Corporations request if his or her duties to the

Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him or

her to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. The Board

of Directors is hereby empowered, by a majority vote of a quorum of the

disinterested Directors, to enter into a contract to indemnify any Director or

officer in respect of any proceeding arising from any act or omission, whether

occurring before or after the execution of such contract.



(3) The Board of Directors is hereby empowered, by majority vote of a quorum

of the disinterested Directors, to cause the Corporation to indemnify or

contract to indemnify any person not specified in subsection (a) or (b) of

Section 2 of this Article V who was, is or may become a party to any

proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an employee, agent

or consultant of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the

Corporation as an employee, agent or consultant of another corporation,

partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,

to the same extent as if such person were specified as one to whom

indemnification is granted in subsection (b) of Section 2 of this Article V.



(4) The provisions of this Article V shall be applicable to all proceedings

commenced after the effective date hereof arising from any act or omission,

whether occurring before or after such effective date. No amendment or repeal

of this Article V shall have any effect on the rights provided under this

Article V with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such

amendment or repeal. The Corporation shall promptly take all such actions, and

make all such determinations, as shall be necessary or appropriate to comply

with its obligation to make any indemnity under this Article V and shall pay

or reimburse promptly all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees,

incurred by such Director or officer in connection with such actions and

determinations or proceedings of any kind arising therefrom.



3



* * *



(5) In the event there has been a change in the composition of a majority of

the Board of Directors after the date of the alleged act or omission with

respect to which indemnification is claimed, any determination as to

indemnification and advancement of expenses with respect to any claim for

indemnification made pursuant to this Article V shall be made by special legal

counsel agreed upon by the Board of Directors and the applicant. If the Board

of Directors and the applicant are unable to agree upon such special legal

counsel, the Board of Directors and the applicant each shall select a nominee,

and the nominees shall select such special legal counsel. Every reference

herein to Directors, officers, trustees, partners, employees, agents or

consultants shall include former Directors, officers, trustees, partners,

employees, agents or consultants and their respective heirs, executors and

administrators. The indemnification hereby provided and provided hereafter

pursuant to the power hereby conferred by this Article V on the Board of

Directors shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which any person may

be entitled, including any right under policies of insurance that may be

purchased and maintained by the Corporation or others, with respect to claims,

issues or matters in relation to which the Corporation would not have the

power to indemnify such person under the provisions of this section. Such

rights shall not prevent or restrict the power of the Corporation to make or

provide for any further indemnity, or provisions for determining entitlement

to indemnity, pursuant to one or more indemnification agreements, bylaws, or

other arrangements (including, without limitation, creation of trust funds or

security interests funded by letters of credit or other means) approved by the

Board of Directors (whether or not any of the Directors of the Corporation

shall be a party to or beneficiary of any such agreements, bylaws or

arrangements); provided, however, that any provision of such agreements,

bylaws or other arrangements shall not be effective if and to the extent that

it is determined to be contrary to this Article V or applicable laws of the

Commonwealth of Virginia.



6\. Each provision of this Article V shall be severable and an adverse

determination as to any such provision shall in no way affect the validity of

any other provision.



7\. Unless otherwise defined, terms used in this Article V shall have the

definitions assigned to them in the VSCA, as it exists on the date hereof or

as hereafter amended.



ARTICLE VI



Article 14 and Article 14.1 of Chapter 9 of Title 13.1 of the Code of Virginia

shall not apply to the Corporation.

               sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a

               fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of

               Common Stock that were outstanding immediately after such event

               and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common

               Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



          (ii) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the

               Series A Preferred Stock as provided in subparagraph (i) of this

               Section 2(A)(b) immediately after it declares a dividend or

               distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable

               in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no

               dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common

               Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment

               Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a

               dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall

               nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend

               Payment Date.



          (iii) Dividends due pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this Section

               2(A)(b) shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding

               shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend

               Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares,

               unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record

               date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case

               dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of

               issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly

               Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the

               determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock

               entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such

               Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such

               dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such

               Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends

               shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A

               Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such

               dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be

               allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such

               shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a

               record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series

               A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or

               distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not

               more than 60 days prior to



                                       3

               the date fixed for the payment thereof.



     (c)  Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall

          have the following voting rights.



          (i)  Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth,

               each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitled the holder

               thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the

               shareholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation

               shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock

               payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or

               combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common

               Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a

               dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser

               number of shares of Common Stock, then the number of votes per

               share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were

               entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by

               multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is

               the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately

               after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

               shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to

               such event.



          (ii) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any Articles of Amendment

               of the Articles of Incorporation creating a series of Preferred

               Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of

               Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common

               Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having

               general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all

               matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Corporation.



          (iii) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law,

               holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights.



     (d)  Certain Restrictions.



          (i)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions

               payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section

               2(A)(b) are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and

               unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on

               shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been

               paid in full, the Corporation shall not:



               (A)  declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions,

                    on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to

                    dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to

                    the Series A Preferred Stock;



               (B)  declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions,

                    on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to

                    dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)

                    with the Series A Preferred



                                       4

<PAGE>



                    Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A

                    Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends

                    are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts

                    to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;

                    or



               (C)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration

                    shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends

                    or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the

                    Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may

                    at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of

                    any such junior stocks in exchange for shares of any stock

                    of the Corporation ranking junior (as to dividends and upon

                    dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A

                    Preferred Stock.



          (ii) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the

               Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration

               any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation

               could, under subparagraph (i) of this Section 2(A)(d), purchase

               or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.



     (e)  Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or

          otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall

          be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All

          such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but

          unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a

          new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and

          restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Articles of

          Incorporation, or in any other Articles of Amendment of the Articles

          of Incorporation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar

          stock or as otherwise required by law.



     (f)  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation,

          dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be

          made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as

          to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the

          Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares

          of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $100.00 per share,

          plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions

          thereon whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided

          that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to

          receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for

          adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate

          amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common

          Stock plus an amount equal to any accrued an unpaid dividends, or (2)

          to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to

          dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the

          Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions made with the Series A

          Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total

          amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such

          liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation

          shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock

          payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a



                                       5

<PAGE>



          subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares

          of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a

          dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of

          shares of Common Stock then in each such case the aggregate amount set

          forth in the preceding sentence to which holders of shares of Series A

          Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be

          adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of

          which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately

          after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares

          of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



     (g)  Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into

          any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which

          the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other

          stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such

          case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be

          similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to

          the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times

          the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other

          property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for

          which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event

          the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the

          Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a

          subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares

          of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a

          dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of

          shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in

          the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of

          shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying

          such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of

          shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and

          the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that

          were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



     (h)  No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be

          redeemable.



     (i)  Amendment. The Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not

          be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the

          powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock

          so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the

          holders of at least (two-thirds) of the outstanding shares of Series A

          Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.



(B)  Preferred Stock.



     Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more

     additional series. Such shares of Preferred Stock may be redeemed,

     purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, subject to any

     limitation or restriction, if any, as is contained in the express terms of

     any series, and may be reissued except as otherwise provided by law.



                                       6

(C)  Common Stock.



     Each share of Common Stock shall be equal to every other share of Common

     Stock, and except as otherwise provided by law or by these Articles of

     Incorporation (including the provisions authorizing the Board of Directors

     to bestow voting rights on any series of Preferred Stock), the holders of

     the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have and possess the exclusive

     right to notice of shareholders' meetings and to vote on all matters

     presented to shareholders and shall be entitled to one vote for each share

     of Common Stock held of record by them on all matters including elections

     of directors.



     Subject to the rights of any series of Preferred Stock authorized by the

     Board of Directors as provided by the Articles of Incorporation, the

     holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to

     dividends as and when declared by the Board of Directors out of funds of

     the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends.



                                   ARTICLE VI



                      Requirements Prior to Doing Business

to be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors in the By-Laws of the

to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders in

2003, the directors of the second class (designated as Class II) shall be

elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders

in 2004, and the directors of the third class (designated as Class III) shall be

in 2005. Commencing with the annual meeting of shareholders in 2003 and at each

annual meeting of shareholders thereafter, the directors in the class whose

terms shall then expire shall be elected for a term of three years and until

their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

     (c) Any or all directors (exclusive of Preferred Stock Directors) may be

shall be held at such place, within or without the State of Indiana, as may be

specified in the notices or waivers of notice of such meetings.

shall be issued or sold in such manner and for such amount of consideration as

may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors.



     Section 4. By-Laws of the Corporation. The Board of Directors by a majority

vote of the actual number of Directors elected and qualified from time to time

shall have the power, without the assent or vote of the shareholders, to make,

alter, amend or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation.



     The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the

actual number of Directors elected and qualified, from time to time, designate

from among its members an executive committee and one or more other committees,

each of which, to the extent provided in the resolution, the Articles of

Incorporation, or the By-Laws, may exercise all of the authority of the Board of

Directors of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, the authority to

issue and sell or approve any contract to issue and sell, securities or shares

of the Corporation or designate the terms of a series of a class of securities

or shares of the Corporation. The terms which may be affixed by each such

committee include, but are not limited to, the price, dividend rate, and

provisions of redemption, a sinking fund, conversion, voting, or preferential

rights or other features of securities or class or series of a class of shares.

Each such committee may have full power to adopt a final resolution which sets

forth those terms and to authorize a statement of such terms to be filed with

the Secretary of State. However, no such committee has the authority to declare

dividends or distributions, amend the Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws,

approve a plan of merger or consolidation even if such plan does not require

shareholder approval, reduce earned or capital surplus, authorize or approve the

reacquisition of shares unless pursuant to a general formula or method specified

by the Board of Directors, or recommend to the shareholders a voluntary

dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation thereof. No member of any such

committee shall continue to be a member thereof after he ceases to be a Director

of the Corporation. The calling and holding of meetings of any such committee

and its method of procedure shall be determined by the Board of Directors. A

member of the Board of Directors shall not be liable for any action taken by any

such committee if he is not a member of that committee and has acted in good

faith and in a manner he reasonably believes is in the best interest of the

Corporation.



     Section 5. Consent Action by Shareholders. Any action required by statute

to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, or any action which may be taken

at a meeting of the shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if, prior to

such action, a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be

signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject

matter thereof, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of the

proceedings of the shareholders.



     Section 6. Consent Action by Directors. Any action required or permitted to

be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may

be taken without a meeting, if prior to such action a written consent to such

action is signed by all members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as

the case may be, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of

proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.

     Section 7. Interest of Directors in Contracts. Any contract or other

transaction between the Corporation or any corporation in which this Corporation

owns a majority of the capital stock shall be valid and binding, notwithstanding

that the directors or officers of this Corporation are identical or that some or

all of the directors or officers, or both, are also directors or officers of

such other corporation.



     Any contract or other transaction between the Corporation and one or more

of its directors or members or employees, or between the Corporation and any

firm of which one or more of its directors are members or employees or in which

they are interested, or between the Corporation and any corporation or

association of which one or more of its directors are stockholders, members,

directors, officers, or employees or in which they are interested, shall be

valid for all purposes notwithstanding the presence of such director or

directors at the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Corporation which acts

upon, or in reference to, such contract or transaction and notwithstanding his

or their participation in such action, if the fact of such interest shall be

disclosed or known to the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors shall

authorize, approve and ratify such contract or transaction by a vote of a

majority of the directors present, such interested director or directors to be

counted in determining whether a quorum is present, but not to be counted in

calculating the majority of such quorum necessary to carry such vote. This

Section shall not be construed to invalidate any contract or other transaction

which would otherwise be valid under the common and statutory law applicable

thereto.



     Section 8. Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees. Every

person who is or was a director, officer or employee of this Corporation or of

any other corporation for which he is or was serving in any capacity at the

request of this Corporation shall be indemnified by this Corporation against any

and all liability and expense that may be incurred by him in connection with or

resulting from or arising out of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, provided

that such person is wholly successful with respect thereto or acted in good

faith in what he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best

interests of this Corporation or such other corporation, as the case may be,

and, in addition, in any criminal action or proceeding in which he had no

reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. As used herein,

""claim, action, suit or proceeding"" shall include any claim, action, suit or

proceeding (whether brought by or in the right of this Corporation or such other

corporation or otherwise), civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,

whether actual or threatened or in connection with an appeal relating thereto,

in which a director, officer or employee of this Corporation may become

involved, as a party or otherwise,



     (i)  by reason of his being or having been a director, officer of employee

          of this Corporation or such other corporation or arising out of his

          status as such or



     (ii) by reason of any past or future action taken or not taken by him in

          any such capacity, whether or not he continues to be such at the time

          such liability or expense is incurred.



The terms ""liability"" and ""expense"" shall include, but shall not be limited to,

attorneys' fees and disbursements, amounts of judgments, fines or penalties, and

amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of a director, officer or employee,

but shall not in any event include any liability or expenses on account of

profits realized by him in the purchase or sale of securities of the Corporation

in violation of the law. The termination of any claim, action, suit or

proceeding, by judgment, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or

conviction or upon a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, or its equivalent,

suits or proceedings made or commenced after the adoption hereof, whether

arising from acts or omissions to act during, before or after the adoption

hereof.

administrators of any such person.

was serving at the request of the Corporation or is or was serving at the

request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another

Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under

the provisions of this Section or otherwise.

          Common Stock shall be entitled to participate

          equally in any dividends (other than dividends

          of Common Stock) which may be declared upon

          Common Stock and no dividends may be declared

          on shares of either class unless an equal

          dividend be declared on the shares of the

          other class; provided, however, that in the

          case of all dividends in Common Stock of this

          Corporation or stock split-ups, the Class A

          Common Stock shall be entitled only to receive

          Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common

          Stock shall be entitled only to receive Class

          B Common Stock.



               (iii)  Shares of Class B Common Stock

          shall be convertible at any time and from time

          to time at the option of the holder thereof

          into shares of Class A Common Stock at the

          rate of one share of Class B Common Stock for

          one share of Class A Common Stock.  In order

          to exercise the conversion privilege, the

          holder of any shares of Class B Common Stock

          shall surrender the certificate or

          certificates for such shares accompanied by

          proper instruments of surrender to the

          Corporation at its principal office.  The

          certificate or certificates for such shares of

          Class B Common Stock shall also be accompanied

          by written notice to the effect that the

          holder elects to convert such shares of Class

          B Common Stock and stating the name or names

          to which the certificate or certificates for

          shares of Class A Common Stock which shall be

          issuable on such conversion shall be issued. 

          As promptly as practicable after the receipt

          of such notice and the surrender of such



<PAGE>



          shares of Class B Common Stock, the

          Corporation's Transfer Agent shall issue and

          deliver to such holder or to the written order

          of such holder a certificate or certificates

          for the number of shares of Class A Common

          Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares

          of Class B Common Stock.  Such conversion

          shall be deemed to have been effected on the

          date on which such notice shall have been

          received by the Corporation and such Class B

          Common Stock shall have been surrendered as

          hereinbefore provided.  The shares of Class B

          Common Stock so converted shall not be

          reissued and shall be retired and cancelled as

          provided by law.  All shares of Class A Common

          Stock which may be issued upon conversion of

          the Class B Common Stock shall, upon issuance,

          be validly issued, fully paid, and non-

          assessable by the Corporation.



               (iv)  In case of the issuance of any

          shares of stock as a dividend upon the shares

          of Class A Common Stock or the shares of Class

          B Common Stock or in the case of any sub-

          division, split-up, combination, or change of

          the shares of Class A Common Stock or shares

          of Class B Common Stock into a different

          number of shares of the same or any other

          class or classes of stock, or in the case of

          any consolidation or merger of the Corporation

          with or into another corporation, or in case

          of any sale or conveyance to another

          corporation of the property of the Corporation

          as an entirety or substantially as an

          entirety, the conversion rate as hereinbefore

          provided shall be appropriately adjusted so

          that the rights of the holders of Class A

          Common Stock and of Class B Common Stock shall

          not be diluted as a result of such stock

          dividend, sub-division, split-up, combination,

          change, consolidation, merger, sale, or

          conveyance.  Adjustments in the rate of

          conversion shall be calculated to the nearest

          1/10 of a share.  The Corporation shall not be

          required to issue fractions of shares of Class

          A Common Stock upon conversion of Class B

          Common Stock.  If any fractional interest in a

          share of Class A Common Stock shall be

          deliverable upon the conversion of any shares

          of Class B Common Stock, the Corporation may

          purchase such fractional interest for an



<PAGE>



          amount in cash equal to the current market

          value of such fractional interest.



               (v)  So long as any shares of Class B

          Common Stock are outstanding, the Corporation

          shall reserve and keep available out of its

          duly authorized but unissued stock, for the

          purpose of effecting the conversion of the

          Class B Common Stock as hereinabove provided,

          such number of its duly authorized shares of

          Class A Common Stock and other securities as

          shall from time to time be sufficient to

          effect the conversion of all outstanding

          shares of Class B Common Stock.



               (vi)  The 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock

          shall be entitled to receive dividends at the

          rate of 5% per annum, payable semi-annually on

          February 1 and August 1 of each year, before

          any dividends shall be paid upon the Class A

          or Class B Common Stock.  Said dividends shall

          be cumulative from year to year if not paid

          and all accrued and unpaid dividends on the

          Preferred Stock must be paid before any

          dividend may be paid upon the Common Stock in

          any year.  This Preferred Stock shall be

          preferred over the Class A and Class B Common

          Stock as to dividends and assets.  In the

          final liquidation of the Corporation, all

          arrearages of dividends on, and the par value

          of, the shares of the Preferred Stock shall be

          first paid to the holders of the Preferred

          Stock before any payments shall be made to the

          holders of the Common Stock.   Holders of the

          Preferred Stock shall not participate in

          earnings beyond said 5%, nor in assets beyond

          accrued dividends and the par value of said

          stock.  The holders of the Preferred Stock

          shall not participate in the management and

          control of the Corporation.  Dividends on the

          Preferred Stock may be paid from current

          earnings or from accumulated earned surplus in

          the discretion of the Directors of the

          Corporation, unless such payment from surplus

          shall be prohibited by the statutes of the

          State of Delaware.  The Corporation has and

          reserves the right to call and retire at any

          time any part or all of the shares of 5%

          Cumulative Preferred Stock at the par value

          thereof plus accrued dividends thereon.

          of such voting rights, which may include the

          right to elect not more than two directors in

          the case of dividend defaults notwithstanding

          the provisions of clause (i) of Subsection (b)

          shares of that series, and, if so, the terms

          and amount of such sinking fund;



               (g)  The rights of the shares of that

          payment of shares of that series;



               (h)  Any other relative rights,

          preferences and limitations of that series.



               Dividends on outstanding shares of

     issued, shall be entitled as of right to purchase or

     subscribe for (1) any unissued shares of stock of any

     class, or (2) any additional shares of any class, Common

     or Preferred, authorized to be issued, or (3) any bonds,

     certificates of indebtedness, debentures, or other

     securities convertible into stock of the Corporation, or

     carrying any right to purchase stock of any class, but

     any such unissued stock or such additional authorized

     issue of any stock or of other securities convertible

     into stock, or carrying any right to purchase stock, may

     be issued and disposed of pursuant to resolution of the

     Board of Directors to such persons, firms, corporations

     or associations and upon such terms as may be deemed

     advisable by the Board of Directors in the exercise of

     holders of four-fifths of all classes of stock of the

     Corporation entitled to vote in elections of Directors,

     considered for purposes of this Article FOURTH as one

     class, shall be required (i) for the adoption of any

     agreement for the merger or consolidation of the

     Corporation with or into any other corporation; (ii) to

     authorize any sale, lease or exchange of all or



<PAGE>



     substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to, or

     the stock of the Corporation otherwise required by law or

     any agreement between the Corporation and any national

     securities exchange.



          (e)  The provisions of sub-section (d) of this

     Article FOURTH shall not be applicable to (i) any merger

     or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any

     or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to,

     or any sale, lease or exchange to the Corporation or any

     subsidiary thereof in exchange for securities of the

     Corporation of any assets of, any other corporation, or

     to liquidation or dissolution, if the Board of Directors

     of the Corporation shall by resolution have approved a

     memorandum of understanding with such other corporation

     with respect to and substantially consistent with such

     transaction or such liquidation or dissolution; or (ii)

     any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with, or

     corporation of which a majority of the outstanding shares

     of all classes of stock entitled to vote in elections of

     Directors is owned of record or beneficially by the

     Corporation and its subsidiaries.



          (f)  No amendment to the Certificate of

     Incorporation of the Corporation shall amend, alter,

     change or repeal any of the provisions of sub-section (d)

     and (e) of this Article FOURTH, unless the amendment

     effecting such amendment, alteration, change or repeal

     shall receive the affirmative vote or consent of the

     R.G. Dickerson                          Dover, Delaware

     J.A. Kent                               Dover, Delaware

     SEVENTH:  The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.  

     EIGHTH:  The private property of the stockholders of the

Corporation shall not be subject to the payment of corporate debts

to any extent whatever.

     NINTH:  For the management of the business and for the conduct

of the affairs of the Corporation, and in further definition,

limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of

its directors and stockholders, it is further provided:

          1.  The number of directors of the Corporation shall

     be as specified in the By-Laws of the Corporation, except

     as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the

     provisions of subparagraph (vii) of paragraph (b) of

     Article FOURTH.  Such number may from time to time be

     increased or decreased in such manner as may be

     prescribed by the By-Laws.  In no event shall the number

     of directors be less than the minimum number prescribed

     by law.  The election of directors need not be by written

     ballot.  There shall be no qualifications on directors

     except that the holders of the Class A Common Stock,

     voting as a class, shall be entitled to vote to adopt By-

     Laws fixing qualifications for the directors elected by

     such class (but not qualifications for the directors

     elected by any other class), and the holders of the Class

     B Common Stock, voting as a class, shall be entitled to

     vote to adopt By-Laws fixing qualifications for the

     directors elected by such class (but not qualifications

     for the directors elected by any other class).  These

     special voting rights are granted in addition to the

     voting rights of such class provided in Article FOURTH of

     the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation.  Any

     amendment to the immediately preceding two sentences

     shall require a class vote of each of the Class A Common

     Stock and the Class B Common Stock.  



          2.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the

     powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware,

     the Board of Directors is expressly authorized and

     empowered:



<PAGE>



               (a)  To make, alter, amend and repeal By-

          Laws, subject to the power of the stockholders

          to alter or repeal the By-Laws made by the

          Board of Directors; provided, however, that

          By-Laws shall not be made, altered, amended or

          repealed by the stockholders of the

          Corporation except, in addition to any other

          vote required by law, by the vote of the

          holders of not less than four-fifths of all

          classes of stock of the Corporation entitled

          to vote in the election of Directors;

          provided, further, that nothing in this

          paragraph (a) shall affect the right of

          stockholders to set qualifications for

          directors as provided in Section 1 of Article

          NINTH.  



               (b)  Subject to the applicable provisions

          of the By-Laws then in effect, to determine,

          from time to time, whether and to what extent

          and at what times and places and under what

          conditions and regulations the accounts and

          books of the Corporation, or any of them,

          shall be open to the inspection of the

          stockholders, and no stockholder shall have

          any right to inspect any account or book or

          document of the Corporation, except as

          conferred by the laws of the State of

          Delaware, unless and until authorized so to do

          by resolution of the Board of Directors or of

          the stockholders of the Corporation.



               (c)  Without the assent or vote of the

          stockholders, to authorize and issue

          obligations of the Corporation, secured or

          unsecured, to include therein such provisions

          as to redeemability, convertibility or

          otherwise, as the Board of Directors, in its

          sole discretion, may determine, and to

          authorize the mortgaging or pledging, as

          security therefor, of any property of the

          Corporation, real or personal, including

          after-acquired property.



               (d)  To establish bonus, profit-sharing

          or other types of incentive or compensation

          plans for the employees (including officers

          and directors) of the Corporation and to fix

          the amount of profits to be distributed or

          shared and to determine the persons to

          participate in any such plans and the amounts

          of their respective participations.



<PAGE>



          In addition to the powers and authorities

     hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon it,

     the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers and

     do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done

     by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the

     provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware, of the

     Certificate of Incorporation and of the By-Laws of the

     Corporation.



          3.  Any director or any officer elected or appointed

     by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors may be

     removed at any time in such manner as shall be provided

     in the By-Laws of the Corporation.



          4.  In the absence of fraud, no contract or other

     transaction between the Corporation and any other

     corporation, and no act of the Corporation, shall in any

     way be affected or invalidated by the fact that any of

     the directors of the Corporation are pecuniarily or

     otherwise interested in, or are directors or officers of,

     such other corporation; and, in the absence of fraud, any

     director, individually, or any firm of which any director

     may be a member, may be a party to, or may be pecuniarily

     or otherwise interested in, any contract or transaction

     of the Corporation; provided, in any case, that the fact

     that he or such firm is so interested shall be disclosed

     or shall have been known to the Board of Directors or a

     majority thereof; and any director of the Corporation who

     is also a director or officer of any such other

     corporation, or who is also interested, may be counted in

     determining the existence of a quorum at any meeting of

     the Board of Directors of the Corporation which shall

     authorize any such contract, act or transaction and may

     vote thereat to authorize any such contract, act or

     transaction, with like force and effect as if he were not

     such director or officer of such other corporation, or

     not so interested.



          5.  Any contract, act or transaction of the

     Corporation or of the directors may be ratified by a vote

     of a majority of the shares having voting powers at any

     meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting called

     for such purpose, and such ratification shall, so far as

     permitted by law and by this Certificate of

     Incorporation, be as valid and as binding as though

     ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation.



          6.  A director of the Corporation shall not be

     personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders

     for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as

     director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the

     director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its



<PAGE>



     stockholders, (ii) for acts or  omissions not in good

     faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a

     knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the

     Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any

     transaction from which the director derived any improper

     personal benefit.  If the Delaware General Corporation

     Law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this

     Section 6 to authorize corporate action further

     eliminating or limiting the personal liability of

     directors, then the liability of a director of the

     Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest

     extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law,

     as so amended.



          Any repeal or modification of the foregoing

     paragraph by the stockholders of the Corporation shall

     not adversely affect any right or protection of a

     director of the Corporation existing at the time of such

     repeal or modification.



          7.  (a)  Right to Indemnification.  Each person who

     was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a

     party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or

     proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

     investigative (hereinafter a ""proceeding""), by reason of

     the fact that such person is or was a director or officer

     of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of

     the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent

     of another corporation or of a partnership, joint

     venture, trust or other enterprise, including service

     with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an

     ""indemnitee""), whether the basis of such proceeding is

     alleged action in an official capacity as a director,

     officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while

     serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall

     be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to

     the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General

     Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be

     amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to

     the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to

     provide broader indemnification rights than permitted

     prior thereto), against all expenses, liability and loss

     (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise

     taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement)

     reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in

     connection therewith and such indemnification shall

     continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a

     director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to

     the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and

     administrators; provided, however, that, except as

     provided in paragraph (b) hereof with respect to

     proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the



<PAGE>



     Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in

     connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated

     by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part

     thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the

     Corporation.  The right to indemnification conferred in

     this Section 7 shall be a contract right and shall

     include the right to be paid by the Corporation the

     expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in

     advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an

     ""advancement of expenses""); provided, however, that, if

     the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an

     advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in such

     indemnitee's capacity as a director or officer (and not

     in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered

     by such indemnitee, including, without limitation,

     service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only

     upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking

     (hereinafter an ""undertaking""), by or on behalf of such

     indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall

     ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from

     which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a

     ""final adjudication"") that such indemnitee is not

     entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this

     Section 7 or otherwise.



          (b)  Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit.   If a claim

     under paragraph (a) of this Section 7 is not paid in full

     by the Corporation within sixty days after a written

     claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the

     case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which

     case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the

     indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against

     the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the

     claim.  If successful in whole or in part in any such

     suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover

     an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an

     undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid

     also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. 

     In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a

     right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit

     brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an

     advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and

     (ii) in any suit by the Corporation to recover an

     advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an

     undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover

     such expenses upon final adjudication that, the

     indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct

     set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

     Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its

     Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its

     stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the

     commencement of such suit that indemnification of the



<PAGE>



     indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the

     indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set

     forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an

     actual determination by the Corporation (including its

     Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its

     stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such

     applicable standard of conduct, shall create a

     presumption that the indemnitee has not met the

     applicable standard of conduct, or, in the case of such

     suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such

     suit.  In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce

     a right to indemnification or to an advancement of

     expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an

     advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an

     undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is

     not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of

     expenses, under this Section 7 or otherwise shall be on

     the Corporation.



          (c)  Non-Exclusivity of Rights.  The rights to

     indemnification and to the advancement of expenses

     conferred in this Section 7 shall not be exclusive of any

     other right which any person may have or hereafter

     acquire under any statute, this Certificate of

     Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or

     disinterested directors or otherwise.



          (d)  Insurance.  The Corporation may maintain

     insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any

     director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation,

     partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise

     against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not

     the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such

     person against such expense, liability or loss under the

     Delaware General Corporation Law.



          (e)  Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the

     Corporation.  The Corporation may, to the extent

     authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors,

     grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement

     of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation

     to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Section

     7 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of

     expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.



          8.   No action required to be taken or which may be

     taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of

     the Corporation may be taken without a meeting, and the

     power of stockholders to consent in writing, without a

     meeting, to the taking of any action is specifically

     denied.

                                   ARTICLE V



     The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time

The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, designated as Class

I, Class II and Class III, respectively.  Directors shall be assigned to each

class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of

Directors.  Until changed by a resolution of the Board of Directors, Class I

resignation, disqualification, removal, or other causes shall be filled by

either (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power

of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation entitled to

vote generally in the election of directors (the ""Voting Stock"") voting together

as a single class; or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the

remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board

of Directors.  Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the

number of directors shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by

resolution that any such newly created directorship shall be filled by the

office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors.  Any director

elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the

remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the new

directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such director's

successor shall have been elected and qualified.



          (ii) There shall be no right with respect to shares of stock of the

Corporation to cumulate votes in the election of directors.

Delaware, as the same may be amended from time to time, a director of the

Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its

stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.

Article XIII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director,

omissions of such director, officer or agent occurring prior to such repeal or

modification

                    voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding

                    up of the affairs of the corporation, regardless of whether

               acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares of such class or

               series of Capital Stock.  If the consideration so paid for shares

               of any class or series of Capital Stock varied as to form, the

               form of consideration for such class or series of Capital Stock

               appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock

               split, combination of shares or similar event.

               Shareholder and prior to the consummation of such Business

               Combination: (i) there shall have been no failure to declare and

               pay at the regular date therefor any full quarterly dividends

               (whether or not cumulative) payable in accordance with the terms

               of any outstanding Capital Stock, except as approved by a

               majority of the Continuing Directors; (ii) there shall have been

               no reduction in the annual rate of dividends paid on the Common

               Stock (except as necessary to reflect any stock dividend, stock

               split, combination of shares or similar event), except as

               approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors; (iii) there

               shall have been an increase in the annual rate of dividends paid

               on the Common Stock as necessary to reflect any reclassification

               (including any reverse stock split), recapitalization,

               reorganization or any similar transaction that has the effect of

               reducing the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, unless

               the failure to increase such annual rate is approved by a

               majority of the Continuing Directors; and (iv) except as approved

               by a majority of the Continuing Directors, such Interested

               Shareholder shall not have become the beneficial owner of any

               additional shares of Capital Stock except as part of the

               transaction that results in such Interested Shareholder becoming

               an Interested Shareholder and except in a transaction that, after

               giving effect thereto, would not result in any increase in the

               Interested Shareholder's percentage beneficial ownership of any

               class or series of Capital Stock.



          e.   After such Interested Shareholder has become an Interested

               Shareholder, such Interested Shareholder shall not have received

               the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a

               shareholder of the corporation), or any loans, advances,

               guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax

               credits or other tax

               advantages provided by the corporation, whether in anticipation

               of or in connection with such Business Combination or otherwise.



          f.   A proxy or information statement describing the proposed Business

               Combination and complying with the requirements of the Securities

               Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder

               (the ""Act"") (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act,

               rules or regulations) shall be mailed to all shareholders of the

               corporation at least 30 days prior to the consummation of such

               Business Combination (whether or not such proxy or information

               statement is required to be mailed pursuant to the Act or

               subsequent provisions).  The proxy or information statement shall

               contain on the first page thereof, in a prominent place, any

               statement as to the advisability (or inadvisability) of the

               Business Combination that a majority of the Continuing Directors

               may choose to make and, if deemed advisable by a majority of the

               Continuing Directors, the opinion of an investment banking firm

               selected by a majority of the Continuing Directors as to the

               fairness (or lack of fairness) of the terms of the Business

               Combination from a financial point of view to the holders of the

               outstanding shares of Capital Stock other than the Interested

               Shareholder and its Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) or

               Associates (as hereinafter defined).



          g.   Such Interested Shareholder shall not have made or caused to be

               made any major change in the corporation's business or equity

               capital structure without the approval of a majority of the

               Continuing Directors.



C.   For the purposes of this Article IV:

          f.   any transaction (whether or not with or otherwise involving an

               Interested Shareholder) that has the effect, directly or

               indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of any class or

               series of Capital Stock, or any securities convertible into

               Capital Stock or into equity securities of any Subsidiary, that

               is beneficially owned by any Interested Shareholder or any

          in the election of directors of the corporation.



     3.   The term ""person"" shall mean any individual, firm, corporation or

          other entity and shall include any group comprised of any person and

          any other person with whom such person or any Affiliate or Associate

          of such person has any agreement, arrangement or understanding,

          respect to any such plan when acting in such capacity) who (a) is the

          beneficial owner of Voting Stock representing ten percent (10%) or

          more of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then

          or succession shall have occurred in the course of a transaction or

          series of transactions not involving a public offering within the

          meaning of the Securities Act of 1933.



     5.   A person shall be a ""beneficial owner"" of any Capital Stock (a) which

          such person or any of its Affiliates or Associates beneficially owns,

          directly or indirectly; (b) which such person or any of its Affiliates

          or Associates has, directly or indirectly, (i) the right to acquire

          rights, warrants or options, or otherwise, or (ii) the right to vote

          agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,

          holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Capital stock. For the

          purpose of determining whether a person is an interested Shareholder

          pursuant to Paragraph 4 of this Section C, the number of shares of

          Capital Stock deemed to be outstanding shall include shares deemed

          beneficially owned by such person through application of this

          Paragraph 5, but shall not include any other shares of Capital Stock

          that may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or

          understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights,

          warrants or options, or otherwise.



     6.   The term ""Affiliate"", used to indicate a relationship with a specified

          person, shall mean a person that directly, or indirectly through one

          or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under

          common control with, such specified person.  The term ""Associate"",

          used to indicate a relationship with a specified person, shall mean

          (a) any person (other than the corporation or a Subsidiary) of which

          such specified person is an officer or partner or is, directly or

          indirectly, the beneficial owner of ten percent (10%) or more of any

          class of equity securities, (b) any trust or other estate in which

          such specified person has a substantial beneficial interest or as to

          which such specified person serves as trustee or in a similar

          fiduciary capacity, (c) any relative or spouse of such specified

          person or any relative of such spouse, who has the same home as such

          specified person or who is a director or officer of the corporation or

          any Subsidiary, and (d) any person who is a director or officer of

          such specified person or any of its parents or subsidiaries (other

          than the corporation or a Subsidiary).



     7.   The term ""Subsidiary"" shall mean any corporation of which a majority

          of any class of equity security is beneficially owned, directly or

          indirectly, by the corporation; provided, however, that for the

          purposes of Paragraph 4 of this Section C, the term ""Subsidiary"" shall

          mean only a corporation of which a majority of each class of equity

          security is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the

          corporation.



     8.   The term ""Continuing Director"" shall mean any member of the Board of

          Directors of the corporation, while such person is a member of the

          to the time that the Interested Shareholder involved in the Business

          Combination in question became an Interested Shareholder, and any

          member of the Board of Directors, while such person is a member of the

          Board of Directors, whose election, or nomination for election by the

          corporation's shareholders, was approved by a vote of a majority of

          the Continuing 



                                       8

          Directors; provided, however, that in no event shall an Interested

          Shareholder involved in the Business Combination in question or any

          Affiliate, Associate or representative of such Interested Shareholder,

          be deemed to be a Continuing Director.



     9.   The term ""Fair Market Value"" shall mean (a) in the case of cash, the

          amount of such cash; (b) in the case of stock, the highest closing

          sale price during the 30-day period immediately preceding the date in

          question of a share of such stock on the Composite Tape for New York

          Stock Exchange-Listed Stocks, or, if such stock is not quoted on the

          Composite Tape on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if such stock is

          not listed on such Exchange, on the principal United States securities

          exchange registered under the Act on which such stock is listed, or,

          period preceding the date in question on the National Association of

          Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System or any similar

          system then in use, or if no such quotations are available, the fair

          market value on the date in question of a share of such stock as

          determined by a majority of the Continuing Directors in good faith;

          and (c) in the case of property other than cash or stock, the fair

          market value of such property on the date in question as determined in

          good faith by a majority of the Continuing Directors.



     10.  In the event of any Business Combination in which the corporation

          survives, the phrase ""consideration other than cash to be received"" as

          used in Paragraphs 2.a and 2.b of Section B of this Article IV shall

          include the shares of Common Stock and/or the shares of any other

          class or series of Capital Stock retained by the holders of such

          shares.



D.   The Continuing Directors by majority vote shall have the power to determine

     for the purposes of this Article IV, on the basis of information known to

     them after reasonable inquiry, (a) whether a person is an Interested

     Shareholder, (b) the number of shares of Capital Stock (including Voting

     Stock) or other securities beneficially owned by any person, (c) whether a

     person is an Affiliate or Associate of another, (d) whether the assets that

     are the subject of any Business Combination equal or exceed ten percent

     (10%) of the book value of the consolidated assets of the corporation, (e)

     whether a proposed plan of dissolution or liquidation is proposed by or on

     behalf of an Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate or Associate of any

     Interested Shareholder, (f) whether any transaction has the effect,

     directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of any class

     or series of Capital Stock, or any securities convertible into Capital

     Stock or into equity securities of any Subsidiary, that is beneficially

     owned by an Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate or Associate of an

     Interested Shareholder, (g) whether any Business Combination satisfies the

     conditions set forth in Paragraph 2 of Section B of this Article IV, and

                                       9

<PAGE>

 



     respect to which a determination is required under this Article IV. Any

     such determination made in good faith shall be binding and conclusive on

     all parties.



E.   Nothing contained in this Article IV shall be construed to relieve any

     Interested Shareholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.



F.   The fact that any Business Combination complies with the provisions of

     Section B of this Article IV shall not be construed to impose any fiduciary

     duty, obligation or responsibility on the Board of Directors, or any member

     thereof, or the Continuing Directors, or any of them, to approve such

     Business Combination or recommend its adoption or approval to the

     shareholders of the corporation, nor shall such compliance limit, prohibit

     or otherwise restrict in any manner the Board of Directors, or any member

     thereof, or the continuing Directors, or any of them, with respect to

     evaluations of or actions and responses taken with respect to such Business

     Combination.



G.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation

     (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage or separate class

     vote may be specified by law or these Articles of Incorporation), the

     affirmative vote of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%)

     of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding

     shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be

     required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provisions inconsistent with,

     this Article IV.



                                   ARTICLE V



No director of the corporation shall be personally liable to the corporation or

its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a

director, provided, however, that this Article V shall not eliminate or limit

the liability of a director to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for any

breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders,

(ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional

misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under section 302A.559 or 80A.23

of the Minnesota Statutes, (iv) for any transaction from which the director

derived an improper personal benefit, or (v) for any act or omission occurring

prior to the effective date of this Article V.  No amendment to or repeal of

this Article V shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged

liability of any director of the corporation for or with respect to any acts or

omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.



                                  ARTICLE VI



The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the

director of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than five nor more than

twenty-one persons, 



                                      10

<PAGE>

 



who need not be shareholders. The number of directors may be increased by the

shareholders or Board of Directors or decreased by the shareholders from the

number of directors on the Board of Directors immediately prior to the effective

date of this Article VI; provided, however, that any change in the number of

directors on the Board of Directors (including, without limitation, changes at

annual meetings of shareholders) shall be approved by the affirmative vote of

not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by the

holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock (as defined in Article

IV), voting together as a single class, unless such change shall have been

approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors. If such change shall

not have been so approved, the number of directors shall remain the same. The

directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and

Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third

of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.



At the 1988 annual meeting of shareholders, Class I directors shall be elected

for a one-year term, Class II directors for a two-year term and Class III

directors for a three-year term.  At each succeeding annual meeting of

shareholders beginning in 1989, successors to the class of directors whose term

expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term.  If the

number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned

among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as

nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to

fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a

term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class.  In no case will

a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent

director.  A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in

which the director's term expires and until a successor shall be elected and

qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement,

disqualification or removal from office.  Removal of a director from office

(including a director named by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy or newly

created directorship), with or without cause, shall require the affirmative vote

of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to be cast by

the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a

single class.  Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an

increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the Board of

Directors then in office, and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of

Directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although

less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.  Any director elected to

fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall

have the same remaining term as that of such director's predecessor.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes

of preferred or preference stock issued by the corporation shall have the right,

voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special

meeting of shareholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and

other features of such directorships shall be governed by or pursuant to the

applicable terms of these Articles of Incorporation, and such directors so

elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Article VI unless

expressly provided by such terms.



                                      11

<PAGE>

 



No person (other than a person nominated by or on behalf of the Board of

Directors) shall be eligible for election as a director at any annual or special

meeting of shareholders unless a written request that his or her name be placed

in nomination is received from a shareholder of record by the Secretary of the

corporation not less than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting,

together with the written consent of such person to serve as a director.



Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation (and

notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage or separate class vote may be

specified by law or these Articles of Incorporation), the affirmative vote of

the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes entitled to

be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting

together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any

provisions inconsistent with, this Article VI.

          and other powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional

          or other rights of the shares of such series and the qualifications,

          limitations and restrictions thereof are as follows:



     SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK



     Section 1.     Designation, Par Value and Amount. The shares of such

series shall be designated as ""Series A Preferred Stock"" (hereinafter referred

to as ""Series A Preferred Stock""), the shares of such series shall be with par

value of $4.00 per share, and the number of shares constituting such series

shall be 200,000.



     Section 2.     Dividends and Distributions.



     (A)  Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any

shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the

shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of

shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and

if declared by the Board of Directors out of assets legally available for the

<PAGE>



December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a ""Quarterly

                                                                    ----------

Dividend Payment Date""), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment

----------------------

Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A

Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to

the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment

hereinafter set forth, 5000 (subject to adjustment) times the aggregate per

share amount of all cash dividends, and 5000 (subject to adjustment) times the

aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other

distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, par

value $.40 per share, of the Corporation (the ""Common Stock"") or a subdivision

                                               ------------

of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise),

declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend

Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,

since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A

Preferred Stock.



     (B)  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the

Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after

it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a

dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no

dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during

the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series A

Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date.



     (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding

shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date

next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock,

unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the

first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares

shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date

of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record

date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock

entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend

Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue

and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid

dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A

Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at

the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a

share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board

of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares

of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or

distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than days

prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.



     Section 3.     Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred

Stock shall have the following voting rights:



     (A)  Except as provided in paragraph C of this Section 3 and subject to

the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A

Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 5000 votes (subject to

adjustment) on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the

Corporation.



                                        2



<PAGE>



     (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of

shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock

shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of

stockholders of the Corporation.



     Section 4.     Certain Restrictions.



     (A)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions

payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in

arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and

distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock

outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not



          (i)       declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions,

     on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon

     liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;



          (ii)      declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions,

     on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or

     upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred

     Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and

     all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in

     proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares

     are then entitled;



          (iii)     redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration

     (except as provided in (iv) below) shares of any stock ranking junior

     (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)

     to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any

     time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior

     stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking

     junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or

     winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;



     (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to

purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the

Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section

4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.



     Section 5.     Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock

purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever

shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such

shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of

Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock

subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the

Certificate of Incorporation, in any other Certificate of Amendment creating a

series of Preferred Stock or as otherwise required by law.

<PAGE>



     Section 6.     Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.



     (A)  Subject to the prior and superior rights of holders of any shares of

any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of

Series A Preferred Stock with respect to rights upon liquidation, dissolution

or winding up (voluntary or otherwise), no distribution shall be made to the

holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon

liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless,

prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have

received $500.00 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid

dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of

such payment (the ""Series A Liquidation Preference""). Following the payment of

                  ---------------------------------

the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional

distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred

Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have

received an amount per share (the ""Capital Adjustment"") equal to the quotient

                                  --------------------

obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 5,000 (the

""Adjustment Number""). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A

-------------------

Liquidation Preference and the Capital Adjustment in respect of all outstanding

shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of

Series A Preferred Stock and holders of Common Stock shall receive their

ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in

the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock

and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.



     (B)  In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available

to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the

liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which

rank on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets

shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the

holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation

preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets

available to permit payment in full of the Capital Adjustment, then such

remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.

Neither merger, consolidation, etc. shall be deemed to be a liquidation,

dissolution or winding up for purposes of this Section 6.



     (C)  In the event the Corporation shall (i) declare any dividend on Common

Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common

Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of

shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately

prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by

a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock

outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the

number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to

such event.



     Section 7.     Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall

enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which

the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or

securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of

Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or

changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment

hereinafter



                                        4



<PAGE>



set forth) equal to 5,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash

and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or

for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the

Corporation shall at any time (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable

in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or

(iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,

then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with

respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall

be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is

the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event

and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that are

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



     Section 8.     No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall

not be redeemable.



     Section 9.     Ranking. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank junior to

all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock as to the payment of

dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series

shall provide otherwise.



     Section 10.    Amendment. The Certificate of Incorporation of the

Corporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially

alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A

Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of

the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series A

Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.

purpose, of the holders of at least two-thirds of the issued

and outstanding Capital Stock of the Corporation.



     (4)  The board of directors may make by-laws from time

to time, and may alter, amend or repeal any by-laws, but any

by-laws made by the board of directors may be altered,

amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote;



     (5)  In case of any vacancy in the board of directors,

or more assistant treasurers, and to the extent provided by

the by-laws or by the board of directors by resolution from

time to time, the persons so appointed shall have and

other and additional officers, with such powers as the

directors may deem advisable;



     (9)  Both stockholders and directors shall have power,

if the by-laws so provide, to hold their meetings and have

one or more offices without the State of North Carolina, and

to keep the books of the Corporation (subject to the

provisions of the statutes) outside of the State of north

Carolina, at such places as may be from time to time

designated;



     (10) The Corporation may in its by-laws confer powers

additional to the foregoing upon the directors, in addition

to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon them

by the statutes;

a director or officer, or are directors or officers of, such

other corporation, and any director or directors,

individually or jointly, may be a party or parties to, or

may be interested in, any contract or transaction of the

no contract, act or transaction of the Corporation with any

in such contract, act or transaction, or in any way

connected with such person or person, firm or corporation,

and each and every such person or persons, firm or

               SECTION 1. Series.

               The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in series.

All shares of Preferred Stock shall be of equal rank and the express terms

the Board of Directors as hereinafter provided, and each share of each series

shall be identical with all other shares of such series, except that in the case

of series on which dividends are cumulative the dates from which dividends are

cumulative may vary to reflect differences in the dates of issue. Subject to the

provisions of Sections 2 through 4, inclusive, of this Part A, which shall apply

to all Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors is hereby authorized to cause

shares of Preferred Stock to be issued in one or more series and with respect to

each such series to fix:

               number, letter, or title.



          (b)  The authorized number of shares of the series, which number the

               Board of Directors may, except to the extent otherwise provided

               in the creation of the series, from time to time, increase or

               decrease, but not below the number of shares thereof then

               outstanding.



          (c)  The dividend rate or rates (which may be fixed or adjustable) of

               the shares of the series.



          (d)  The dates on which dividends, if declared, shall be payable and,

               in the case of series on which dividends are cumulative, the

               dates from which dividends shall be cumulative.



<PAGE>   3



          (e)  The redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of

               the series.



          (f)  The amount, terms, conditions, and manner of operation of any

               retirement or sinking fund to be provided for the purchase or

               redemption of shares of the series.



          (g)  The amounts payable on shares of the series in the event of any

               liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of the

               Corporation.



          (h)  Whether the shares of the series shall be convertible into Common

               Shares or shares of any other series or class, and, if so, the

               specification of such other class or series, the conversion price

               or prices or rate or rates, any adjustment thereof, and all other

               terms and conditions upon which such conversion may be made.



          (i)  The restrictions, if any, upon the issue of any additional shares

               of the same series or of any other class or series.



                  The Board of Directors is authorized to adopt from time to

time amendments to these articles of incorporation fixing, with respect to each

series, the matters described in Clauses (a) through (i), inclusive, of this

Section 1.



                SECTION 2.  Voting Rights.

                ----------  --------------



          (a) The holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote upon

          matters presented to the shareholders, except as provided in this

          Section 2 or as required by law.



          (b) If the Corporation shall fail to pay full dividends on any series

          of Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend payment periods, whether

          or not consecutive, the number of directors will be increased by two,

          and the holders of all outstanding series of Preferred Stock, voting

          as a single class without regard to series, will be entitled to elect

          such additional two directors until full cumulative dividends for all

          past dividend payment periods on all series of Preferred Stock have

          been paid or declared and set apart for payment and non-cumulative

          dividends have been paid regularly for at least one full year. Such

          right to vote separately as a class to elect directors shall, when

          vested, be subject, always, to the same provisions for the vesting of

          such right to elect directors separately as a class in the case of

          future dividend defaults. At any time when such right to elect

          directors separately as a class shall have so vested, the Corporation

          may, and upon the written request of the holders of record of not less

          than twenty percent of the total number of shares of the Preferred

          Stock of the Corporation then outstanding shall, call a special

          meeting of shareholders for the election of such directors. In the

          case of such a written request, such special meeting shall be held

          within ninety days after the delivery of such request and, in either

          case, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the

          Regulations of the Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall

          not be required to call



<PAGE>   4



          such a special meeting if such request is received less than 120 days

          before the date fixed for the next ensuing annual meeting of

          shareholders of the Corporation. Directors elected as aforesaid shall

          serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation

          or until their respective successors shall be elected and qualify. If,

          prior to the end of the term of any director elected as aforesaid, a

          vacancy in the office of such director shall occur during the

          continuance of a default in dividends on any series of Preferred Stock

          by reason of death, resignation or disability, such vacancy shall be

          filled for the unexpired term by the appointment by the remaining

          director or directors elected as aforesaid of a new director for the

          unexpired term of such former director.



          (c) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least

          two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, given in

          person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting called for the

          purpose at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall vote separately

          as a class, shall be necessary to effect any amendment, alteration, or

          repeal of any of the provisions of these articles of incorporation or

          the regulations of the Corporation which would be substantially

          prejudicial to the voting powers, rights, or preferences of the

          holders of Preferred Stock (but so far as the holders of Preferred

          Stock are concerned, such action may be effected with such vote or

          consent); provided, however, that neither the amendment of these

          articles of incorporation to authorize or to increase the authorized

          or outstanding number of shares of any class ranking junior to or on a

          parity with the Preferred Stock, nor the amendment of the regulations

          so as to change the number of directors of the Corporation, shall be

          deemed to be substantially prejudicial to the voting powers, rights,

          or preferences of the holders of Preferred Stock (and any such

          amendment referred to in this proviso may be made without the vote or

          consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock); and provided further

          that if such amendment, alteration, or repeal would be substantially

          prejudicial to the rights or preferences of one or more but not all

          then outstanding series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote or

          consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding

          shares of the series so affected shall also be required.



          (d) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least

          two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, given in

          person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting called for the

          purpose at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall vote as a single

          class shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the following:



               (i) The authorization of, or the increase in the authorized

               number of, any shares of any class ranking prior to the Preferred

               Stock; or



               (ii) The purchase or redemption for sinking fund purposes or

               otherwise of less than all of the then outstanding Preferred

               Stock except in accordance with a purchase offer made to all

               holders of record of Preferred Stock, unless all dividends on all

               Preferred Stock then outstanding for all previous dividend

               periods shall have been declared and paid or funds therefor set

               apart and all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable thereto

               shall have been complied with.

issued for cash, property, services or otherwise.

     payment of dividends or as to distribution in the event of a liquidation,

     dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are given preference over the

     rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.



(b)  Whenever reference is made to shares ""on a parity with the Preferred

     in respect of which the rights of the holders thereof as to the payment of

     or winding up of the Corporation rank on an equality or parity with the

     rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.



(c)  Whenever reference is made to shares ""ranking junior to the Preferred

     Stock,"" such reference shall mean and include all shares of the Corporation

     in respect of which the rights of the holders thereof as to the payment of

     dividends and as to distributions in the event of a liquidation,

     dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are junior or subordinate to

     the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.



                                     PART B

                                       OF

                    SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.



         ONE:    The name of this corporation is SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES

INTERNATIONAL, INC.

        

         TWO:    The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act

or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General

Corporation Law of California other than the banking business, the trust

company business or the practice of a profession permitted to be        

incorporated by the California Corporations Code.

        

         THREE:  This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of shares

designated, respectively, ""Common Stock"" and ""Preferred Stock.""  The number of

shares of Common Stock authorized to be issued is one hundred million

(100,000,000) and the number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized to be      

issued is one million (1,000,000).



                 The Preferred Stock may be divided into such number of series

as the Board of Directors may determine.  The Board of Directors is authorized

to determine and alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions

granted to and imposed upon the Preferred Stock or any series thereof with

respect to any wholly unissued class or series of Preferred Stock, and to fix

the number of shares of any series of Preferred Stock and the designation of

any such series of Preferred Stock.  The Board of Directors, within the limits

and restrictions stated in any resolution of the Board of Directors originally

fixing the number of shares constituting any series, may increase or decrease

(but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number

of shares of any series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series.



         FOUR:   The liability of the directors of this corporation for

monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under

California law.



         FIVE:   This corporation is authorized to indemnify the directors and

officers of this corporation to the fullest extent permissible under California

law.



         SIX:    Any action required or permitted to be taken by the

shareholders of this corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or

special meeting of shareholders of this corporation and may not be effected     

by any consent in writing by such shareholders.



<PAGE>   2



    SEVEN:       The bylaws shall set forth the number of directors

constituting the Board of Directors.  The directors shall be divided into three

classes, as nearly equal in number as reasonably possible, with the term of

office of the first class to expire at the 1995 annual meeting of shareholders,

the term of office of the second class to expire at the 1996 annual meeting of

shareholders and the term of office of the third class to expire at the 1997

annual meeting of shareholders.  At each annual meeting of shareholders

following such initial classification and election, directors elected to

succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of

office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of shareholders after

their election.



                 Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of

Preferred Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from

any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the

Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement,

disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled only by a

majority vote of the directors then in office though less than a quorum, and

directors so chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting

of shareholders at which the term of office of the class to which they have

been elected expires.  No decrease in the number of directors constituting the

Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.



                 This provision shall become effective only when this

corporation becomes a ""listed"" corporation within the meaning of Section 301.5

of the General Corporation Law of California.



         EIGHT:  Upon this corporation becoming a ""listed"" corporation within

the meaning of Section 301.5 of the General Corporation Law of California,

shareholders shall not have cumulative voting rights in the election of

directors.



         NINE:   Bylaws of this corporation shall be adopted, amended or

repealed only by the Board of Directors or the affirmative vote of the holders

of at least eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of all of the then

outstanding shares of the capital stock of this corporation entitled to vote

generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

majority of the Continuing Directors; and (c) such Interested Shareholder shall

shall be mailed to all shareholders of this corporation at least 30 days prior

to the consummation of such Business Combination (regardless of whether such

proxy or information statement is required to be mailed pursuant to such Act or

property of the corporation, either real or personal, or to issue

bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations without any such

security, and to sell or pledge such bonds, notes or other

obligations for its proper corporate purposes.  



      (12)     To make and enter into lawful contracts and

arrangements of every name and nature with any association or

corporation, public or private, including any corporation or

association in which the directors, officers or stockholders of

this corporation may be interested or of which they or any of

them may be officers, directors or stockholders, or with any

individual or firm whatsoever, whether such individual or any

member of such firm be an officer, director or stockholder of

this corporation, or an officer, director of stockholder of any

other corporation or association in which this corporation may be

interested.  



      (13)      To remunerate any person, firm or corporation for

                 FOURTH:       1.  AUTHORIZED SHARES.  The total

number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the

corporation shall have authority to issue is seventy million

(70,000,000), consisting of fifty million (50,000,000) shares of

Common Stock, par value 69 4/9 cents per share (""Common Stock""),

and twenty million (20,000,000) shares of Class B Common Stock,

par value 69 4/9 cents per share (""Class B Common Stock"").  



                 2.  COMMON STOCK AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK.  (a)

The powers, preferences and rights of the Common Stock and the

Class B Common Stock, and the qualifications, limitations or

restrictions thereof, shall be in all respects identical, except

as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in these

Articles of Incorporation.  

<PAGE 11>

      (b)(1)      At each annual or special meeting of

stockholders, each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to

one (1) vote in person or by proxy for each share of Common Stock

standing in his name on the stock transfer records of the

corporation and each holder of Class B Common Stock shall be

entitled to ten (10) votes in person or by proxy for each share

of Class B Common Stock standing in his name on the stock

transfer records of the corporation.  Except as set forth herein,

all actions submitted to a vote of stockholders shall be voted on

by the holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock

voting together as a single class.  



      (2)      In addition to any other votes which may be

required pursuant to these Articles of Incorporation, Virginia

law or otherwise, the affirmative vote of the holders of

two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B

Common Stock, each voting separately as a class, shall be

required to authorize any amendment to this subdivision (b)(2) or

subdivision (b)(4) of these Articles of Incorporation.  



      (3)      The holders of the Common Stock and the Class B

Common Stock  shall each be entitled to vote separately as a

class with respect to (i)  other amendments to these Articles of

Incorporation that alter or change the powers, preferences or

special rights of their respective class of stock so as to affect

them adversely, including proposals to change the number of

authorized shares of their respective class of stock, (ii)

amendments to these Articles of Incorporation authorizing

additional shares of Common Stock or Class B Common Stock and

(iii)  such other matters as may require class voting under the

Virginia Stock Corporation Act.  The holders of the Common Stock

and the Class B Common Stock shall also be entitled to each vote

separately as a class upon any proposal to issue authorized but

unissued shares of Class B Common Stock, except for shares issued

pursuant to the initial distribution of shares of Class B Common

Stock as a pro rata dividend to the holders of the Common Stock

or in connection with stock splits, stock dividends or similar

distributions.  



      (4)      In addition to any other votes which may be

required pursuant to these Articles of Incorporation, Virginia

law or otherwise, so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock

are outstanding, the affirmative vote of the holders of more than

two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B

Common Stock, each voting separately as a class, shall be

required to authorize:



      (A)      any merger or consolidation of the corporation

with or into any other corporation or any statutory exchange of

shares to which the corporation is a party; or 



      (B)      any dissolution of the corporation;  



provided that the foregoing shall not apply to any merger or

consolidation described in subparagraph (A) if the other party to

the merger or consolidation is a Subsidiary of the corporation.  



                 For purposes of this subdivision (b)(4), a

""Subsidiary"" is any corporation more than 50% of the voting

securities of which are owned directly or indirectly by the

corporation.  



<PAGE 12>

                (c)     If and when dividends on the Common Stock

and the Class B Common Stock are declared payable from time to

time by the Board of Directors as provided in subdivision (b),

whether payable in cash, in property or in shares of stock of the

corporation, the holders of the Common Stock and the holders of

the Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to share equally, on a

per share basis, in such dividends, except that, if dividends are

declared that are payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B

Common Stock, dividends shall be declared that are payable at the

same rate on both classes of stock and the dividends payable in

shares of Common Stock shall be payable to the holders of that

class of stock and the dividends payable in shares of Class B

Common Stock shall be payable to the holders of that class of

stock except for shares issued pursuant to the initial

distribution of shares of Class B Common Stock.  If the

corporation shall in any manner subdivide or combine the

outstanding shares of Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, the

outstanding shares of the other such class of stock shall be

proportionally subdivided or combined in the same manner and on

the same basis as the outstanding shares of Common Stock or Class

B Common Stock, as the case may be, have been subdivided or

combined.  



                (d)(1)     The holder of each outstanding share

of Class B Common Stock shall have the right at any time, or from

time to time, at such holder's option, to convert such share into

one fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock, on and

subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.  



      (2)     In order to exercise his conversion privilege, the

holder of any shares of Class B Common Stock to be converted into

shares of Common Stock shall present and surrender the

certificate representing such shares of Class B Common Stock

during usual business hours at any office or agency of the

corporation maintained for the transfer of shares of Class B

Common Stock and shall deliver a written notice of the election

of such holder to convert the shares represented by such

certificate or any portion thereof specified in such notice. 

Such notice shall also state the name or names (with address) in

which the certificate or certificates representing shares of

Common Stock which shall be issuable on such conversion shall be

issued.  If so required by the corporation, any certificate for

shares of Class B Common Stock surrendered for conversion into

shares of Common Stock shall be accompanied by instruments of

transfer, in form satisfactory to the corporation, duly executed

by the holder of such shares of Class B Common Stock or his duly

authorized representative.  Each conversion of shares of Class B

Common Stock into shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have

been effected on the date (the 



""conversion date"") on which the certificate or certificates

representing such shares of Class B Common Stock shall have been

surrendered for conversion into shares of Common Stock and such

notice and any required instruments of transfer shall have been

received as aforesaid, and the person or persons in whose name or

names any certificate or certificates representing shares of

Common Stock which shall be issuable on such conversion shall be

deemed to have become immediately prior to the close of business

on the conversion date the holder or holders of record of the

shares of Common Stock represented thereby.  



      (3)     As promptly as practicable after the presentation

and surrender for conversion into shares of Common Stock, as

herein provided, of any certificate representing shares of Class

B Common Stock, the corporation shall issue and deliver at such

office or agency, to or upon the written order of the holder

thereof, certificates representing the number of shares of Common

Stock issuable upon such conversion.  In case any certificate

representing shares of Class B Common Stock shall be surrendered

for conversion of a part only of the shares represented thereby

into shares of Common Stock, the corporation shall deliver at

such office or agency, to or upon the written order of the holder

thereof, a certificate or certificates representing the number 

<PAGE 13>

of shares of Class B Common Stock represented by such surrendered

certificate, which are not being converted.  The issuance of

certificates representing shares of Common Stock issuable upon

the conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock shall be made

without charge to the converting holder for any tax imposed on

the corporation in respect of the issue thereof.  The corporation

shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be

payable with respect to any transfer involved in the issue and

delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the

holder of the shares being converted, and the corporation shall

not be required to issue or deliver any such certificate unless

and until the person requesting the issue thereof shall have paid

to the corporation the amount of such tax or shall have

established to the satisfaction of the corporation that such tax

has been paid.  



      (4)     Upon any conversion of shares of Class B Common

Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto, no adjustment

with respect to dividends shall be made; only those dividends

shall be payable on the shares of Class B Common Stock so

converted as may be declared and may be payable to holders of

record of shares of Class B Common Stock on a date prior to the

conversion date with respect to the shares of Class B Common

Stock so converted; and only those  dividends shall be payable on

shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion of shares of

Class B Common Stock as may be declared and may be payable to

holders of record of shares of Common Stock on or after such

conversion date.  



      (5)     All shares of Class B Common Stock which shall have

been surrendered for conversion into shares of Common Stock as

herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and

all rights with respect to such shares of Class B Common Stock,

including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote,

shall thereupon cease and terminate, except only the right of the

holders thereof, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (3) of

this subdivision (d), to receive shares of Common Stock in

exchange therefor.  



      (6)     Such number of shares of Common Stock as may from

time to time be required for such purpose shall be reserved for

issuance upon conversion of outstanding shares of Class B Common

Stock.  



      (7)     At any time when the number of ""outstanding"" shares

of Class B Common Stock as reflected on the stock transfer

records of the corporation falls below 14% of the aggregate

number of ""outstanding"" shares of Common Stock and of Class B

Common Stock, then the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock

shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, on

a share-for-share basis.  For purposes of the immediately

preceding sentence:  (i) the total number of shares of Common

Stock and/or Class B Common Stock ""outstanding"" at any time shall

not include any shares of Common Stock which, after May 15, 1987,

are (a) issued in exchange for the assets or stock of other

entities (including pursuant to a merger or other business

combination), (b)  sold by the corporation for value, (c) issued

upon conversion of convertible securities issued in exchange for

the assets or stock of other entities or sold by the corporation

for value or (d)  issued as a stock split or dividend with

respect to shares issued or sold pursuant to clause (a), (b) or

(c) above; and (ii)  any shares of Common Stock repurchased by

the corporation shall no longer be deemed ""outstanding"" from and

after the date of repurchase.  In the event the Common Stock is

delisted from the New York Stock Exchange or the New York Stock

Exchange commences proceedings for delisting and the Common Stock

will be precluded by rule or law from being quoted on the

National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation

System or a successor automated quotation system, the Board of

Directors of the corporation shall have 

<PAGE 14>

the right by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors to

cause each share of Class B Common Stock then issued and

outstanding or held as a treasury share to be immediately

converted into one share of Common Stock. 



      (8)     In the event of any automatic conversion of the

Class B Common Stock pursuant to subdivision (d)(7), certificates

which formerly represented outstanding shares of Class B Common

Stock will thereafter be deemed to represent a like number of

shares of Common Stock.  



                      (e)(1)   No person or persons holding

shares of Class B Common Stock (hereinafter called a ""Class B

Holder"") may transfer, and the corporation shall not register the

transfer of, such shares of Class B Common Stock, whether by

sale, assignment, gift, bequest, appointment or otherwise, except

to a Permitted Transferee of such Class B Holder, which term

shall have the following meanings:  



      (i)     In the case of a Class B Holder who is a natural

person and the holder of record and beneficial owner of the

shares of Class B Common Stock subject to said proposed transfer,

""Permitted Transferee"" means (A) the spouse of such Class B

Holder, (B)  a lineal descendant of a great grandparent of such

Class B Holder or a spouse of any such lineal descendant, (C) the

jurisdiction, (D) the executor or administrator of the estate of

such deceased Class B Holder, (E) a trustee of a trust (including

a voting trust) for the benefit of one or more Class B Holders,

other lineal descendants of a great grandparent of such Class B

Holder, the spouse of such Class B Holder, the spouses of such

other lineal descendants and an organization, contributions to

which are deductible for federal income, estate or gift tax

purposes (hereinafter called a ""Charitable Organization""), and

for the benefit of no other person, provided that such trust may

grant a general or special power of appointment to the spouse of

such Class B Holder, any lineal descendant of such Class B Holder

or the spouse 



of any such lineal descendant, and may permit trust assets to be

used to pay taxes, legacies and other obligations of the trust or

the estate of such Class B Holder payable by reason of the death

of such Class B Holder and provided that such trust prohibits

transfer of shares of Class B Common Stock to persons other than

Permitted Transferees, as defined in clause (ii) below, (F) a

Charitable Organization established by such Class B Holder, such

Class B Holder's spouse, a lineal descendant of a great

grandparent of such Class B Holder, a spouse of any such lineal

descendant, the corporation or employees or former employees (or

directors or former directors) of the corporation, and (G) a

corporation all the outstanding capital stock of which is owned

by, or a partnership all the partners of which are, one or more

of such Class B Holders, other lineal descendants of a great

grandparent of such Class B Holder or a spouse of any such lineal

descendant and the spouse of such Class B Holder, provided that

if any share of capital stock of such a corporation (or of any

survivor of a merger or consolidation of such a corporation), or

any partnership interest in such a partnership, is acquired by

any person who is not within such class of persons, all shares of

Class B Common Stock then held by such corporation or

partnership, as the case may be, shall be deemed without further

act to be converted into shares of Common Stock and stock

certificates formerly representing such shares of Class B Common

Stock shall 

<PAGE 15>

thereupon and thereafter be deemed to represent the like number

of shares of Common Stock. 



      (ii)     In the case of a Class B Holder holding the shares

trustee pursuant to a trust other than a trust described in

clause (iii) below, ""Permitted Transferee"" means (A) any

common great grandparent with the creator of the Transferee Trust

or the spouse of the creator of such Transferee Trust. 



          (iv)     In the case of a Class B Holder who is the

record (but not beneficial) owner of the shares of Class B Common

Stock subject to said proposed transfer as nominee for the person

who was the beneficial owner thereof on the Record Date,

""Permitted Transferee"" means such beneficial owner and a

Permitted Transferee of such beneficial owner determined pursuant

to clause (i), (ii), (iii), (v) or (vi) hereof, as the case may

be.

          (vii)     In the case of a Class B Holder who is the

executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased Class B

Holder, guardian or conservator of the estate of a disabled or

incapacitated Class B Holder or who is a trustee of the estate of

a bankrupt or insolvent Class B Holder, and provided such

deceased, disabled or incapacitated, bankrupt or insolvent Class

B Holder, as the case may be, was the record and beneficial owner

of the shares of Class B Common Stock subject to said proposed

transfer,  ""Permitted Transferee"" means a Permitted Transferee of

such deceased, disabled or incapacitated, bankrupt or insolvent

of subdivision (e)(1) and of subdivision (e)(4) hereof pertaining

to automatic conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock into

shares of Common Stock, unless and until the question has been

raised as to whether particular shares have been so converted by

written notice to the Secretary of the corporation, the

classification of such shares as shown on the share transfer

books of the corporation may be relied upon for all proper

corporate purposes.  



                    (f)(1)   Shares of Class B Common Stock shall

outstanding Common Stock may be registered in the same name and

manner as the certificates representing the shares of Common

Stock with respect to which the shares of Class B Common Stock

were issued and, provided further, however, that any certificates

representing shares of Class B Common Stock originally issued in

""nominee"" name may be transferred and reissued in the name of

another ""nominee"" so long as the beneficial owner of the shares

represented by such certificate does not change as a result of

such transfer.  For the purposes of this subdivision (f), the

term ""beneficial owner(s)"" of any shares of Class B Common Stock

shall mean the person or persons who possess the power to vote or

            (2)     The corporation shall note on the

certificates representing the shares of Class B Common Stock that

there are restrictions on transfer and registration of transfer

imposed by subdivision (e) and this subdivision (f).  



                    (g)     Except as otherwise provided in

Common Stock issued in connection with stock splits, stock

dividends and other similar distributions, the corporation shall

date shares of Class B Common Stock are first issued by the

corporation.  All shares of Class B Common Stock surrendered for

conversion shall resume the status of authorized but unissued

shares of Class B Common Stock.  



                     (h)     Dividends may be declared and paid

to the holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock

in cash, property, or other securities of the corporation out of

any net profits or net assets of the corporation legally

available therefor.  

<PAGE 18>

                    (i)     Upon any liquidation, dissolution or

winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary,

the remaining net assets of the corporation shall be distributed

pro rata to the holders of the Common Stock and Class B Common

Stock in accordance with their respective rights and interests.  



                    (j)     Except as otherwise provided by law,

the holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock

shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of

directors and for all other purposes, each holder of the Common

Stock and the Class B Common Stock being entitled to vote as

provided in subdivision (b).  



                    (k)     No holder of shares of Common Stock

or Class B Common Stock shall, by reason of such holding, have

any preemptive right to subscribe to any additional issue of

stock of any class or series of the corporation nor to any

security of the corporation convertible into such stock.  



                     FIFTH:  The period for the duration of the

corporation is unlimited.  



                     SIXTH:  [This Article is no longer

                    SEVENTH:  The amount of real estate to which

the holdings of the corporation at any time are to be limited is

100,000 acres.  



                    EIGHTH:  The following provisions are

inserted for the regulation and conduct of the affairs of said

corporation, and it is expressly provided that the same are

intended to be in furtherance and not in limitation or exclusion

of the powers conferred by statute.  



                    (1)     The by-laws of the corporation may

fix the number of directors and may prescribe the number

necessary to constitute a quorum thereof, and from time to time,

the number may be increased or decreased, provided that in no

case shall the number of directors be less than three; they shall

be elected at the annual meeting of the corporation held each

year at the time and place provided for in said by-laws and shall

hold office, unless sooner removed by the stockholders, for one

year and until their successors are respectively elected and

qualify, and a majority of them shall constitute a quorum for the

transaction of business.  

                    (2)     The board of directors, by resolution

passed by a majority of the whole board, may designate two or

more of their number to constitute an executive committee, which

committee shall, for the time being, as provided in said

resolution or the by-laws have and exercise any or all of the

powers of the board of directors which may be lawfully delegated

in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation,

and shall have power to authorize the seal of the corporation to

be affixed to all papers which may require it.  



                    (3)     The board of directors shall have

power to make, alter, or amend the by-laws of the corporation,

but the by-laws so made, altered or amended may be altered or

repealed by the stockholders.  



                    (4)     The corporation may in its by-laws

make any other provisions or requirements for the management and

conduct of the business of the corporation, provided the same be

contrary to the laws of the State of Virginia or the United

States.  



                    (5)     Any officer elected or appointed by

the board of directors, or by the executive committee, or by the

stockholders, or any member of the executive committee, or of any

other standing committee, or any director of the corporation may

shall be provided in the by-laws of the corporation.  



<PAGE 19>

                    (6)     The corporation in its by-laws or by

resolution of its stockholders or directors shall have the right

to prescribe reasonable rules and regulations subject to which

the right to inspect the books and accounts of the corporation

may be exercised by the stockholders conformably to the laws of

the State of Virginia.  



                    (7)     Notice of the time and place of the

holding of any annual or other meeting of the stockholders shall

be given by mailing at least two weeks before the meeting a

written or printed notice thereof to each stockholder at his post

office address of record with the corporation, and such notice

shall be sufficient without publication or other form of notice

but the by-laws of the corporation may provide for additional

notice of any such meeting to be given to the stockholders.  If

any stockholder shall fail or decline to furnish his address to

the Secretary of the corporation, then it shall not be necessary

to mail to him any such notice except as may otherwise be

required by law.  



                    (8)     The by-laws of the corporation may

provide that the directors may hold their meetings and have an

office or offices outside of the State of Virginia and that any

or all of the books of account and stock books may be kept

outside of said State and at any such office except as otherwise

provided by the laws of the State of Virginia.  



                   (9)     Any stockholder may by or pursuant to

an agreement in writing transfer his stock to any person or

persons for the purpose of vesting in him or them the right to

such agreement; and, provided such agreement or a copy thereof

shall have been furnished to the corporation, such transferees

shall in all things act and during the time limited in such

agreement vote upon such stock pursuant to such agreement and in

such manner as it shall provide and shall exercise such

discretion in carrying out or formulating policies and plans of

action as may be granted by such agreement, and may elect one or

more of their number directors of the corporation.  



                    (10)     With the consent in writing or

pursuant to the vote of the holders of a majority in interest of

the capital stock issued and outstanding, the board of directors

shall have power and authority to lease, sell, assign, transfer,

convey or otherwise dispose of the whole of the property of the

corporation as an entirety, irrespective of the effect thereof

upon the continuance of the business of the corporation and the

exercise of its franchises, but the corporation shall not be

dissolved save as provided by the laws of the State of Virginia. 



                    NINTH:  There shall be no individual or

personal liability on any stock subscriber beyond the obligation

convertible into stock of the corporation, but any such bonds,

debentures, certificates of indebtedness or other securities may

be issued, sold or disposed of pursuant to resolution of the

upon such terms and conditions as may be deemed advisable by the

board of directors in the exercise of its discretion.  



                    ELEVENTH:  No person who is or was at any

time an officer or director of the corporation shall be

personally liable to the corporation or its shareholders for

damages arising out of any act or omission in such person's

capacity as an officer or director; provided, however, that the

provisions of this Article ELEVENTH shall not eliminate or limit

the liability if the officer or director engaged in willful

misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or of any

federal or state securities laws, including without limitation,

any claim of unlawful insider trading or manipulation of the

market for any security.  This Article shall not affect the

liability of an officer or director with respect to any action or

omission occurring prior to the date that Article 

<PAGE 20>

ELEVENTH becomes effective.  No amendment to or repeal of this

Article ELEVENTH shall apply to or have any effect on the

liability or alleged liability of any director or officer of the

corporation for or with respect to any act or omission of such

officer or director occurring prior to such amendment or  repeal.



                    TWELTH:  (1)  To the extent permitted by

Virginia law, the corporation shall indemnify any person who was

or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any

threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,

whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative

(including an action by or in the right of the corporation) by

reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer

of 



the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the

corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or

agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership,

joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,

against expenses (including counsel fees), judgments,

settlements, penalties, fines, including any excise tax assessed

with respect to employee benefit plans, actually incurred by him

or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding except

that no director or officer shall be indemnified against his or

her willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal

law.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Article

shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid

by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such

proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,

however, the payment of such expenses in advance of the final

disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to

the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such

director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall

ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not

entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise.  The

corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide

indemnification to employees and agents of the corporation with

the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of

directors and officers.  



                    (2)     The indemnification and advancement

of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article

shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or

officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors

and administrators of such a person.  



                    (3)     No right provided to any person

pursuant to this Article may be reduced or eliminated by any

amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the

corporation with respect to any act or omission occurring prior

to the adoption of such amendment.

(D) Compliance with the Communications Act of 1934 and the Regulations

thereunder



(1) Proof of Ownership. If the Corporation has reason to believe that the

ownership, or proposed ownership, of shares of capital stock of the

Corporation by any holder or any person presenting any shares of capital stock

of the Corporation for transfer into his name (a Proposed Transferee) may be

inconsistent with, or in violation of, any provision of the Federal

Communications Laws (as



2

#####  



hereinafter defined), such holder or Proposed Transferee, upon request of the

Corporation, shall furnish promptly to the Corporation such information with

respect to citizenship and other ownership interests and affiliations, as the

Corporation shall reasonably request to determine whether the ownership of, or

the exercise of any rights with respect to, shares of capital stock of the

Corporation by such stockholder or Proposed Transferee is inconsistent with,

or in violation of, the Federal Communications Laws.



(2) Rights of Corporation upon Inconsistency or Violation. If any holder or

Proposed Transferee from whom information is requested should fail to respond

to such request pursuant to Section (1) of this Division (D), or if the

Corporation shall conclude that the ownership of, or the exercise of any

rights of ownership with respect to, shares of capital stock of the

Corporation by such stockholder or Proposed Transferee could result in any

inconsistency with, or violation of, the Federal Communications Laws, the

Corporation may (i) refuse to permit the transfer of shares of capital stock

of the Corporation to such Proposed Transferee, (ii) suspend those rights of

stock ownership the exercise of which would result in any inconsistency with,

or violation of, the Federal Communications Laws, or (iii) redeem such shares

of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Division (D)(3) hereof.

In the case of clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence, such refusal of

transfer or suspension shall remain in effect until the requested information

has been received or until the Corporation has determined that such transfer,

or the exercise of such suspended rights, as the case may be, is permissible

under the Federal Communications Laws. The Corporation may exercise any and

all appropriate remedies, at law or in equity in any court of competent

jurisdiction, against any such holder or Proposed Transferee, with a view

towards obtaining such information or preventing or curing any situation which

would cause any inconsistency with, or violation of, any provision of the

Federal Communications Laws.



(3) Redemption. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, outstanding shares of capital

stock of the Corporation shall always be subject to redemption by the

Corporation, by action of the Board of Directors, if in the judgment of the

Board of Directors such action should be taken, pursuant to Section 151(b)(2)

of the GCL or any other applicable provision of law, to the extent necessary

to prevent the loss or secure the reinstatement of any license or franchise

from any governmental agency held by the Corporation or any of its

subsidiaries to conduct any portion of the business of the Corporation or any

of its subsidiaries, which license or franchise is conditioned upon some or

all of the holders of the Corporations stock possessing prescribed

qualifications. The terms and conditions of such redemption shall be as

follows:



i. The redemption price of the shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Division

(D) shall be equal to the lesser of (a) the Fair Market Value (as hereinafter

defined), or (b) if such stock was purchased by a Disqualified Holder (as

hereinafter defined) within one year of the Redemption Date, such Disqualified

Holders purchase price for such shares.



ii. The redemption price of such shares may be paid in cash, Redemption

Securities (as hereinafter defined) or any combination thereof.



iii. If less than all the shares held by Disqualified Holders are to be

redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected in such manner as shall

be determined by the Board of Directors, which may include selection first of

the most recently purchased shares thereof, selection by lot, or selection in

any other manner determined by the Board of Directors.



iv. At least 30 days written notice of the Redemption Date (as hereinafter

defined) shall be given to the record holders of the shares selected to be

redeemed (unless waived in writing by any such holder), provided that the

Redemption Date may be the date on which written notice shall be given to

record holders provided that the cash or Redemption Securities necessary to

effect the redemption shall have been deposited in trust for the benefit of

such record holders

and such cash or Redemption Securities are subject to immediate withdrawal by

them upon surrender of the stock certificates for their shares to be redeemed.



v. From and after the Redemption Date, any and all rights of whatever nature,

which may be held by the owners of shares selected for redemption (including

without limitation any rights to vote or participate in dividends declared on

stock of the same class or series as such shares), shall cease and terminate

and they shall thenceforth be entitled only to receive the cash or Redemption

Securities payable upon redemption.

a. Disqualified Holder shall mean any holder of shares of stock of the

of its subsidiaries.

traded on any securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market, Fair

Market Value shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

case no such sale takes place, the average of the reported closing bid and

asked prices on the principal United States securities exchange registered

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on which such stock is listed, or,

price or bid quotation for such stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market or another

market or system then in use, or if no such prices or quotations are

available, the fair market value on the day in question as determined by the

Board of Directors in good faith.



d. Federal Communications Laws shall mean any law of the United States now

or hereafter in effect (and any regulation thereunder) pertaining to the

to paragraph (iv) of this Division (D)(3), at least equal to the price

required to be paid pursuant to paragraph (i) of this Division (D)(3)

(assuming, in the case of Redemption Securities to be publicly traded, such

intestate, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or by reason of

the fact that such director or officer, at the request of the Corporation is

or was serving any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,

that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the

Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or

his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) in

unless such proceeding(or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the

Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred

by this Article X shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the

expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in

advance of its final disposition.

the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of

stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise

or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence of

such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the

said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said

application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of

creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the

Corporation, as thecae may be, and also on the Corporation.



XII.



The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any

provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the

manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Restated Certificate of

Incorporation, the Corporations By-laws or the GCL and all rights conferred

     stock  which the  Corporation  has  authority  to issue is six  hundred and

     ninety million  (690,000,000)  shares, having an aggregate par value of six

     million nine hundred thousand dollars  ($6,900,000.00),  consisting of five

<PAGE>



          FOURTH:  Voting  Rights.  (a)  Holders  of  Class A Common  Stock  are

     entitled  to one (1) vote per  share of such  stock  held  and,  except  as

     provided  below,  holders of Class B Common  Stock are entitled to ten (10)

     votes per  share of such  stock  held  with  respect  to  matters  properly

     submitted for the vote of holders of Common Shares at any duly  constituted

     meeting of stockholders. The holders of Common Shares will vote together as

     a single class on all matters  properly  presented to the  stockholders for

     their vote  unless  otherwise  required  by law.  The holders of the Common

     Shares are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of any directors.



               (b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  holders  of Class B Common

     Stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote per share with  respect to: (i) any

     proposed  ""Rule 13e-3  transaction,""  as that term is defined in Rule 13e-3

     promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  between

     the  Corporation  and any person who held  stock in the  Corporation  as of

     January 1, 1995 (the  ""Controlling  Stockholders""),  any Affiliate (as such

     term is defined below) of the Controlling Stockholders,  or any group which

     the  Controlling  Stockholders  are an Affiliate  or which the  Controlling

     Stockholders are a member; (ii) any disposition of all or substantially all

     of  the  Corporation's   assets;  (iii)  any  sale  or  transfer  or  other

     disposition of assets which would cause a fundamental  change in the nature

     of the Corporation's  business; and (iv) a merger or a consolidation of the

     Corporation  subsequent  to which the holders of the Common Shares will own

     less  than  50% of the  common  stock  of the  Corporation  following  such

     transaction.



               For the purpose of paragraph (b) above, an ""Affiliate"" is defined

     as: (i) any individual or entity that, directly or indirectly, controls, is

     controlled  by,  or  is  under  the  common  control  of  the   Controlling

     Stockholders;   (ii)  any  corporation  or  organization  (other  than  the

     Corporation or a majority owned subsidiary of the Corporation) of which any

     of the  Controlling  Stockholders is an owner or partner or is, directly or

     indirectly,  the beneficial owner of ten percent (10%) or more of any class

     of voting securities or in which any of the Controlling  Stockholders has a

     substantial   beneficial   interest;   (iii)  a  voting  trust  or  similar

     arrangement pursuant to which any of the Controlling Stockholders serves as

     a trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity; or (v) any relative or spouse

     of the  Controlling  Stockholders  or any relative of such spouse  provided

     such spouse has the same residence as the Controlling Stockholder.

          FIFTH: Conversion of Class B Common Stock.



          (a) In the event that the number of shares of the Corporation's Common

     Shares held in the aggregate by Controlling Stockholders falls to below ten

     percent (10%) of the total number of Common Shares outstanding,  each share

     of Class B Common  Stock shall at that time be  automatically  converted to

     one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock.



          (b)  Upon the sale or  other  transfer  by a holder  of Class B Common

     Stock to a person or entity other than a Permitted Transferee (as such term

     is  defined  below),   such  shares  of  Class  B  Common  Stock  shall  be

     automatically  converted  into an equal  number of shares of Class A Common

     Stock.  Promptly  upon such sale or other  transfer,  the holder of Class B

     Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly

     endorsed in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer,  at the

     office of the  Corporation  or of any transfer agent for the Class A Common

     Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office: (i)

     stating  that the shares are being  converted  pursuant to this  paragraph,

     (ii)  identifying  the  number  of  shares  of Class B Common  Stock  being

     converted,  and (iii)  setting out the name or names (with  addresses)  and

     denominations  in which the certificate or certificates  for Class A Common

     Stock shall be issued and shall include  instructions for delivery thereof.

     Delivery of such notice  together with the  certificates  representing  the

     Class B Common Stock shall  obligate the  Corporation or its transfer agent

     to issue and deliver at such stated  address to such  stated  transferee  a

     certificate or certificates for the number of Class A Common Stock to which

     such transferee is entitled,  registered in the name of such transferee. In

     the  event  of a sale or other  transfer  of less  than all of the  Class B

     Common Stock  evidenced by a certificate  surrendered to the Corporation in

     the accordance with the above procedures, the Corporation shall execute and

     deliver to the transferor, without charge, a new certificate evidencing the

     number of shares of Class B Common Stock not sold or otherwise transferred.



               For the purpose of paragraph (b) above, a ""Permitted  Transferee""

     is defined as:



     (i) (A)  any  Controlling  Stockholder;  (B) the  estate  of a  Controlling

     Stockholder;  (C) the spouse or former spouse of a Controlling Stockholder;

     (D) any lineal descendent of a Controlling Stockholder,  any spouse of such

     lineal descendent, a Controlling Stockholder's grandparent, parent, brother

     or sister or a Contolling Stockholder's spouse's brother or sister; (E) any

     guardian or custodian



                                       3



<PAGE>



     (including  a custodian  for  purposes of the Uniform Gift to Minors Act or

     Uniform  Transfers  to Minors Act) for, or any  conservator  or other legal

     representative of, one or more Permitted  Transferees;  or (F) any trust or

     savings or retirement account,  including an individual  retirement account

     for purposes of federal income tax laws,  whether or not involving a trust,

     principally for the benefit of one or more Permitted Transferees, including

     any trust in respect of which a  Permitted  Transferee  has any  general or

     special   testamentary   power  of   appointment   or  general  or  special

     non-testamentary  power  of  appointment  which  is  limited  to any  other

     Permitted Transferee;



     (ii) the Corporation;



     (iii)  any  employee  benefit  plan or trust  thereunder  sponsored  by the

     Corporation or any of its subsidiaries;



     (iv)  any  trust  principally  for  the  benefit  of  one  or  more  of the

     individuals,  persons,  firms or  entities  (""Persons"")  referred to in (i)

     through (iii) above;



     (v) any corporation,  partnership, or other entity if all of the beneficial

     ownership is held by one or more of the Persons  referred to in (i) through

     (iv) above;



     (vi)  any  voting  trust  for the  benefit  of one or  more of the  Persons

     referred to in (i) through (iv) above; and



     (vii) any  broker or dealer in  securities,  clearing  house,  bank,  trust

     company,  savings and loan association or other financial institution which

     holds the Class B Common Stock for the benefit of a Controlling Stockholder

     or Permitted Transferee thereof.



          (c)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth  herein,  any

     holder of Class B Common  Stock  may  pledge  his  shares of Class B Common

     Stock to a  pledgee  pursuant  to a bona  fide  pledge  of such  shares  as

     collateral  security for indebtedness due to the pledgee without causing an

     automatic  conversion  of such shares into Class A Common  Stock,  provided

     that such shares may not be transferred to or registered in the name of the

     pledgee  unless  such  pledgee is a Permitted  Transferee.  In the event of

     foreclosure  or other  similar  action by a pledgee  who is not a Permitted

     Transferee,  such pledged shares of Class B Common Stock shall be converted

     automatically,  without any act or deed on the part of the  Corporation  or

     any other person, into shares of Class A Common Stock as provided above.



                                       4



<PAGE>



          (d) Each share of Class B Common  Stock shall be  convertible,  at the

     option of its holder, into one fully paid and non-assessable share of Class

     A Common Stock at any time. In the event of such voluntary conversion,  the

     procedures set forth in paragraph (a) above shall be followed.



          (e) Shares of Class B Common Stock that are  converted  into shares of

     Class A Common Stock due to a sale, transfer, or voluntary conversion shall

     continue to be authorized  shares of Class B Common Stock and available for

     reissue by the Corporation as determined by the Board of Directors.



          (f) The Corporation hereby reserves and shall at all times reserve and

     keep  available,  out of its  authorized and unissued Class A Common Stock,

     for the  purpose of  effecting  the  conversions  provided  for  herein,  a

     sufficient  number  of  shares  of  Class A  Common  stock  to  effect  the

     conversion of all Class B Common Stock. All of the Common Stock so issuable

     shall,   when  issued,   be  duly  and  validly  issued,   fully  paid  and

     non-assessable,  and free from liens and charges with respect to the issue.

     The  Corporation  will take such action as may be  necessary to ensure that

     all such Common Stock may be so issued without  violation of any applicable

     law or regulation,  or of any  requirements of any stock exchange or market

     on which any of the Common Shares are listed or quoted.



          (g)  In  any  merger,  consolidation,  or  business  combination,  the

     consideration  to be  received  per share by the  holders of Class A Common

     Stock and Class B Common Stock must be  identical  for each class of stock,

     except that in any such  transaction in which shares of common stock are to

     be  distributed,  such shares may differ as to voting  rights to the extent

     that voting  rights  differ  among Class A Common  Stock and Class B Common

     Stock as provided herein.



          SIXTH: Preferred Stock.



          The Board of Directors shall have authority to classify and reclassify

     any of the unissued  shares of Preferred Stock from time to time by setting

     or  changing  in any one or  more  respects  the  liquidation  or  dividend

     preferences,  conversion  or other  rights,  voting  powers,  restrictions,

     limitations  as to  dividends,  qualifications  or terms or  conditions  of

     redemption of the Preferred  Stock;  provided,  however,  that the Board of

     Directors  shall not  classify  or  reclassify  any such shares into Common

     Shares,  or into any class or  series of stock  which has the same



                                       5



<PAGE>



     or lower  liquidation  priority  as the Common  Shares.  Any and all shares

     issued and for which full consideration has been paid or delivered shall be

     deemed fully paid stock, and the holder thereof shall not be liable for any

     further payment thereon.  Notwithstanding anything in these Articles to the

     contrary, as long as any of the Common Shares shall be listed and quoted on

     the  NASDAQ  National  Market  System,  no  Preferred  Stock  may be issued

     pursuant to the  provisions  of this Article  SIXTH which would violate the

     applicable  Voting Rights Policy of the NASDAQ National  Market System,  as

     the same may be amended from time to time.



          SEVENTH: Other Stock Rights.



               (a) Except as  provided  hereinabove,  each of the Common  Shares

     issued and outstanding shall be identical in all respects, and no dividends

     shall be paid on any of the Common  Shares unless the same dividend is paid

     on all of the  Common  Shares at the time of such  payment.  Except for and

     subject to those special  voting  rights  expressly  granted  herein to the

     holders of the Class B Common Stock, the holders of the Common Shares shall

     have  exclusively  all other  rights  of  stockholders  including,  but not

     limited to, (i) the right to receive dividends, when and as declared by the

     Board of Directors out of assets lawfully available  therefor,  and (ii) in

     the event of any  distribution of assets upon  liquidation,  dissolution or

     winding up of the  Corporation or otherwise,  the right to receive  ratably

     all of the assets and funds of the Corporation  remaining after the payment

     to the creditors of the Corporation.



               (b) Stock Splits and  Combinations.  If the Corporation  shall in

     any manner  subdivide (by stock split,  reclassification,  stock  dividend,

     recapitalization,  or  otherwise)  or combine  (by  reverse  stock split or

     otherwise) the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common

     Stock,  then the  outstanding  shares of each other class of Common  Shares

     shall be  subdivided  or combined,  as the case may be, to the same extent,

     share and share alike.



               (c) As long as any of the  Common  Shares  shall  be  listed  and

     quoted  on the  NASDAQ  National  Market,  the  Board of  Directors  of the

     Corporation  shall ensure,  and shall have all powers  necessary to ensure,

     that the  membership  of the Board of Directors  shall at all times include

     such  number of  ""Independent  Directors""  (as such term is defined in Part

     III, Section 6(c) of Schedule D to the By-Laws of the National  Association

     of Securities Dealers,  Inc. (""NASD""), as the



                                       6



<PAGE>



     same may be amended  from time to time) as shall be required by the By-Laws

     of the NASD for the Common  Shares to be eligible for listing and quotation

     of the NASDAQ  National  Market.  In the event that the Common Shares shall

     cease  to  be  listed  and  quoted  on  the  NASDAQ  National  Market,  and

     subsequently  are listed and quoted on an exchange or other trading system,

     the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall ensure,  and shall have all

     powers  necessary to ensure,  that the membership of the Board of Directors

     shall at all times be consistent with the applicable rules and regulations,

     if any, for the Common  Shares to be eligible for listing and  quotation on

     such exchange or other trading system.



               (c) No holder  of Common  Shares  or  Preferred  Shares  shall be

     entitled to preemptive or subscription rights.



          EIGHTH:  Principal Office & Registered  Agent. The post office address

     of the principal  office of the  Corporation  in this State is 2000 W. 41st

     Street, Baltimore,  Maryland 21211. The name and post office address of the

          NINTH:  Participation  of Non-Citizens.  The following  provisions are

     included  for the purpose of ensuring  that control and  management  of the

     Corporation  remains with citizens of the United States and/or corporations

     formed  under the laws of the  United  States  or any of the  states of the

     United States, as required by the  Communications  Act of 1934, as the same

     may be amended from time to time:



               (a) The  Corporation  shall  not  issue to (i) a person  who is a

     citizen  of a  country  other  than the  United  States;  (ii)  any  entity

     organized  under the laws of a government  other than the government of the

     United States or any state,  territory, or possession of the United States;

     state,   territory,   or  possession  of  the  United  States;  or  (iv)  a

     representative  of, or an  individual or entity  controlled  by, any of the

     foregoing (individually, an ""Alien""; collectively,  ""Aliens"") any shares of

     capital stock of the Corporation if such issuance would result in the total

     number of shares of such  capital  stock held or voted by Aliens  exceeding

     25% of (i) the total number of all shares of such capital stock outstanding

     at any time and from time to time,  or (ii) the total  voting  power of all

     shares of such capital stock  outstanding  and entitled to vote at any time

     and from time to time and shall not permit the transfer on the books of



                                        7



<PAGE>



     the  Corporation of any capital stock to any Alien that would result in the

     total  number  of  shares  of such  capital  stock  held or voted by Aliens

     exceeding  such 25% limits as such  limits  greater or lesser  than 25% may

     subsequently be imposed by statute or regulation.



               (b) No Alien or Aliens,  individually or  collectively,  shall be

     entitled  to vote or direct or control the vote of more than 25% of (i) the

     total number of all shares of capital stock of the Corporation  outstanding

     at any time and from time to time,  or (ii) the total  voting  power of all

     shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote

     at any time and from time to time as such limits greater or lesser than 25%

     may subsequently be imposed by statute or regulation.



               (c) No  Alien  shall be  qualified  to act as an  officer  of the

     Corporation and no more than one-fourth of the total number of directors of

     the Corporation at any time may be Aliens except as may be permitted by law

     or regulation.



               (d) The Board of  Directors  shall have all powers  necessary  to

     implement the  provisions  of this ARTICLE  NINTH and to ensure  compliance

     with the alien ownership restrictions (the ""Alien Ownership  Restrictions"")

     of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  and  the  rules  and

     regulations promulgated thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to

     time  (collectively,   the  ""Communications   Act""),   including,   without

     limitation,  the power to  prohibit  the  transfer of any shares of capital

     stock of the Corporation to any Alien and to take or cause to be taken such

     action as it deems appropriate to implement such prohibition.



               (e)  Without   limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing  and

     notwithstanding  any other provision of these Amended and Restated Articles

     of  Incorporation  to the  contrary,  any  shares of  capital  stock of the

     Corporation  determined by the Board of Directors to be owned  beneficially

     by an  Alien or  Aliens  shall  always  be  subject  to  redemption  by the

     Corporation by action of the Board of Directors,  pursuant to Section 2-310

     of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or any other applicable  provision

     of law, to the extent  necessary  in the judgment of the Board of Directors

     to comply with the Alien Ownership  Restrictions.  The terms and conditions

     of such redemption shall be as follows:



                   (i)  the  redemption  price  of  the  shares  to be  redeemed

     pursuant to this  ARTICLE  NINTH shall be equal to the fair market value of

     the shares to be redeemed,  as determined by reference



                                       8



<PAGE>



     to the  closing  price of such shares on the last  business  day before the

     date of  redemption  if the shares are traded on a national  exchange or as

     determined  by the Board of  Directors  in good faith if the shares are not

     then being traded on a national exchange;



                   (ii) the redemption price of such shares may be paid in cash,

     securities or any combination thereof;



                   (iii) if less than all the  shares  held by Aliens  are to be

     redeemed,  the  shares  to be  redeemed  shall be  selected  in any  manner

     determined by the Board of Directors to be fair and equitable;



                   (iv) at least 10 days' written notice of the redemption  date

     shall be given to the record holders of the shares  selected to be redeemed

     (unless waived in writing by any such holder), provided that the redemption

     date may be the  date on  which  written  notice  shall be given to  record

     holders if the cash or securities  necessary to effect the redemption shall

     have been  deposited  in trust for the benefit of such  record  holders and

     subject  to  immediate  withdrawal  by them  upon  surrender  of the  stock

     certificates for their shares to be redeemed;



                   (v) from and  after the  redemption  date,  the  shares to be

     redeemed shall cease to be regarded as  outstanding  and any and all rights

     of the holders in respect of the shares to be redeemed or attaching to such

     shares of whatever nature  (including,  without  limitation,  any rights to

     vote or  participate  in  dividends  declared on stock of the same class or

     series as such shares) shall cease and terminate,  and the holders  thereof

     thenceforth  shall be  entitled  only to  receive  the  cash or  securities

     payable upon redemption; and



                   (vi)  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  the  Board  of

     Directors shall determine.



          For purposes of this ARTICLE NINTH,  the  determination  of beneficial

     ownership  of  shares of  capital  stock of the  Corporation  shall be made

     pursuant to Rule 13d-3, 17 C.F.R.  ss.  240.13d-3,  as amended from time to

     time, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



          TENTH: Directors.

                                       9



<PAGE>



     than thirteen (13) directors.  The exact number of directors shall be fixed

     from  time to time by the  Board  of  Directors  pursuant  to a  Resolution

     adopted by a majority of the entire  Board of  Directors.  Directors  shall

     hold office for a term of one (1) year or until the first annual meeting of

     stockholders  following  their election.  Each director  elected shall hold

     office until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify.



               (b) Newly created  directorships  resulting  from any increase in

     the  authorized  number  of  directors  or any  vacancies  in the  Board of

     Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement,  disqualification,

     removal from office,  or other cause shall be filled by a majority  vote of

     the remaining  directors,  though less than a quorum,  and the directors so

     chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual  meeting of

     stockholders at which the successors shall be elected and shall qualify.



               (c) At any meeting of the  stockholders  called for the  purpose,

     any  director  may,  by a  majority  vote  of all of the  shares  of  stock

     outstanding  and entitled to vote,  be removed  from  office,  but only for

     cause.



               (d)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in these  Amended  and

     Restated Articles of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of

     stockholders  holding  a  majority  of the  votes  entitled  to be cast for

     election  of  directors  shall be  required to amend or repeal or adopt any

     provision inconsistent with this ARTICLE TENTH.

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION



OF



MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC.



1\. The name of the corporation is Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

(hereinafter the Corporation).



2\. The number of shares the Corporation is authorized to issue is One Hundred

Ten Million (110,000,000), divided into One Hundred Million (100,000,000)

Common Shares and Ten Million (10,000,000) Preferred Shares, each with a par

value of one cent ($.01) per share.



The preferences, limitations and relative rights of each class and series of

shares are as follows:



(a) Common Shares



The common shares shall be entitled to one vote per share and to all other

rights of shareholders subject only to any rights granted to Preferred Shares

under subparagraph (b) of this Article 2.



(b) Preferred Shares



The Preferred Shares may be issued in one or more series with such

designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights as the board of

directors may determine from time to time in accordance with applicable law.



3\. The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of

North Carolina is 225 Hillsborough Street, Raleigh, Wake County, North

Carolina 27603; and the name of its registered agent at such address is CT

Corporation System.



4\. The name and address of the incorporator are Russell M. Robinson, II, 1900

Independence Center, Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina 28246.



5\. (a) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be not less than nine

(9) nor more than eleven (11). By vote of a majority of the Board of Directors

or shareholders of the Corporation, the number of directors of the Corporation

may be increased or decreased, from time to time, within the range above

specified; provided, however, that the tenure of office of a director shall

not be affected by any decrease in the number of directors so made by the

Board or the shareholders.



* * *



(b) (i) The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I,

Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be

possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the Board

of Directors. Prior to the 1997 annual meeting of shareholders, the Board of

Directors shall determine which directors shall be designated as Class I,

Class II and Class III directors. The term of the initial Class I directors

shall terminate on the date of the 1997 annual meeting of shareholders; the

term of the initial Class II directors shall terminate on the date of the 1998

annual meeting of shareholders; and the term of the initial Class III

directors shall terminate on the date of the 1999 annual meeting of

shareholders. At each annual meeting of shareholders beginning in 1997,

successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting

shall be elected for a three-year term. Those persons who receive the highest

number of votes at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be deemed to

have been elected.



(ii) If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be

apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in

each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case will a decrease in the

number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director

shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his or her

term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall

qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement,

disqualification or removal from office.



(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more

classes or series of Preferred Shares issued by the Corporation shall have the

right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual

or special meeting of shareholders, the election, term of office, filling of

vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the

terms of these Restated Articles of Incorporation or the resolution or

resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Article 2(b) of

these Restated Articles of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such

directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this

Article 5(b) unless expressly provided by the terms of such Preferred Shares.



(c) Vacancies in the Board of Directors, except for vacancies resulting from

an increase in the number of directors, shall be filled only by a majority

vote of the remaining directors then in office, though less than a quorum,

except that vacancies resulting from removal from office by a vote of the

shareholders may be filled by the shareholders at the same meeting at which

such removal occurs. Vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of

directors shall be filled only by a majority vote of the Board of Directors.

Any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next

shareholders meeting at which directors are elected. No decrease in the

number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall affect the

tenure of any incumbent director.



-2- 



* * *



(d) Except as otherwise provided herein, any of the directors or the entire

Board of Directors, as the case may be, may be removed at any time, but only

for cause, by a vote of the shareholders and if the number of votes cast to

remove such director(s) or the entire Board of Directors, as the case may be,

exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove such director(s) or the entire

Board of Directors, as the case may be. Cause for removal shall be deemed to

exist only if the director(s) whose removal is proposed has been convicted in

a court of competent jurisdiction of a felony or has been adjudged by a court

of competent jurisdiction to be liable for fraudulent or dishonest conduct, or

gross abuse of authority or discretion, with respect to the Corporation, and

such conviction or adjudication has become final and non-appealable. If a

director is elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the shareholders

of that voting group may participate in the vote to remove such director. A

director may not be removed by the shareholders at a meeting unless the notice

of the meeting states that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting

is removal of the director. If any directors are so removed, new directors may

be elected at the same meeting.



6\. To the fullest extent permitted by the North Carolina Business Corporation

Act as it exists or may hereafter be amended, no person who is serving or who

has served as a director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the

Corporation or any of its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of duty

as a director. No amendment or repeal of this Article, nor the adoption of any

provision to these Restated Articles of Incorporation inconsistent with this

Article, shall eliminate or reduce the protection granted herein with respect

to any matter that occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.



7\. The provision of Article 9 of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act

entitled The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act and of Article 9A

entitled The North Carolina Control Share Acquisition Act shall not be

applicable to the Corporation.



8\. (a) Any purchase by the Corporation of shares of Voting Stock (as

hereinafter defined) from an Interested Shareholder (as hereinafter defined)

who has beneficially owned such securities for less than two years prior to

the date of such purchase or any agreement in respect thereof, other than

pursuant to an offer to the holders of all of the outstanding shares of the

same class as those so purchased, at a per share price in excess of the Market

Price (as hereinafter defined), at the time of such purchase or any agreement

in respect thereof (whichever is earlier), of the shares so purchased, shall

require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power

be, and also on this Corporation.



     SEVENTH.  (1) To the fullest extent that the Oklahoma  General  Corporation

Act as it existed on  December  16, 1987 (the  original  date of filing with the

Oklahoma  Secretary  of  State  of  the  Amended  and  Restated  Certificate  of

Incorporation  originally  containing  this  Article  SEVENTH)  (the  ""Effective

Date""), permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors,  no

director  of  this  Corporation  shall  be  liable  to this  Corporation  or its

stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. No

amendment to or repeal of this Article SEVENTH shall apply to or have any effect

on the liability or alleged liability of any director of this Corporation for or

with respect to any acts or omissions of such  director  occurring  prior to the

time of such amendment or repeal.



     (2) If the Oklahoma General  Corporation Act is amended after the Effective

Date to further limit or eliminate liability of this Corporation's directors for

breach of  fiduciary  duty,  then a director  of this  Corporation  shall not be

liable for any such  breach to the  fullest  extent  permitted  by the  Oklahoma

General  Corporation Act as so amended.  If the Oklahoma General Corporation Act

is amended  after the  Effective  Date to increase or expand  liability  of this

Corporation's  directors for breach of fiduciary  duty, no such amendment  shall

apply to or have  any  effect  on the  liability  or  alleged  liability  of any

director of this  Corporation  for or with  respect to any acts or  omissions of

such  director  occurring  prior  to the  time of such  amendment  or  otherwise

adversely  affect  any right or  protection  of a director  of this  Corporation

existing at the time of such amendment.



     EIGHTH. Repealed.



     NINTH.   Notwithstanding   anything   contained  in  the   Certificate   of

Incorporation or the bylaws of the Corporation to the contrary:



     Section 1.  Number,  Election  and  Terms.  The Board of  Directors  of the

Corporation  shall  consist  of not less than  three  nor more than  twenty-four

members  with the  exact  number  to be fixed  from time to time by the Board of

Directors.  Upon the  adoption of this Article  NINTH,  the  directors  shall be

divided into three classes,  designated Class A, Class B, and Class C, as nearly

equal in number as possible, with the term of office of the Class C directors to

expire at the 1988  annual  meeting of  shareholders,  the term of office of the

Class B directors to expire at the 1989 annual meeting of shareholders,  and the

term of office of the Class A directors to expire at the 1990 annual  meeting of

shareholders.   At  each  meeting  of   shareholders   following   such  initial

classification and election,  the number of directors equal to the number of the

class whose term  expires at the time of such  meeting  shall be elected to hold

office until the third succeeding annual meeting of shareholders.  Each director

shall hold office  until his  successor is elected and  qualified,  or until his

earlier resignation or removal.



     Section  2.  Newly  Created  Directorships  and  Vacancies.  Newly  created

directors  resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors and

any  vacancies  in the Board of  Directors  resulting  from death,  resignation,

retirement,  disqualification,  removal from office or other cause may be filled

only by the  affirmative  vote of 80% of the directors then in office,  although

less  than a quorum,  and  directors  so chosen  shall  hold  office  for a term

expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders at which the term of the class to

which they have been  elected  expires  and until his  successor  is elected and

qualified.



     Section 3. Removal. At a meeting of shareholders or directors,  as the case

may be, called expressly for that purpose, any director,  or the entire Board of

Directors,  may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause,  only

by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares

of the  Corporation  then entitled to be voted in an election of directors or by

the  affirmative  vote of at least  two-thirds  (2/3) of the  directors  then in

office.



     Section 4. Amendment,  Repeal,  Etc. The affirmative vote of the holders of

at least 80% of the outstanding  shares of the  Corporation  then entitled to be

voted in an election of directors  shall be required to alter,  amend or repeal,

or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article NINTH.



     TENTH.  Except upon the affirmative  vote of  shareholders  holding all the

issued and outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation,  no amendment to this

Certificate  of  Incorporation  may be adopted by the  Corporation  which  would

impose personal  liability for the debts of the Corporation on the  shareholders

of the  Corporation or which would amend,  alter or repeal this Article TENTH or

would adopt any provision inconsistent with this Article TENTH.



     ELEVENTH.  The shareholders of the Corporation duly adopted the Amended and

Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation   originally  containing  this  Article

ELEVENTH  (as filed with the  Oklahoma  Secretary of State on December 16, 1987)

for the purpose of  definitively  providing  that all provisions of the Oklahoma

General  Corporation Act will apply to the  Corporation and its  shareholders to

the  fullest  extent,  and that from and after the  filing of such  Amended  and

Restated  Certificate with the Oklahoma Secretary of State the provisions of the

Oklahoma  Business  Corporation  Act  and  any and  all  rights,  privileges  or

immunities  thereunder shall be of no further force or effect with regard to the

Corporation and its shareholders.



     TWELFTH.  Subject  to the  limitations  set  forth in this  Certificate  of

Incorporation,  the Corporation  reserves the right to amend,  alter,  change or

repeal any provision  contained in this  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  in the

manner now or hereafter  prescribed by statute,  and all rights  conferred  upon

shareholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.



     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the undersigned  officers of Pre-Paid Legal Services,

Inc. have signed this Amended and Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  this

24th day of June, 2005.

            shares of Preferred Stock shall constitute part of such series, or

            may decrease (but not below the number of shares thereof then

            the Corporation entitled to vote, and the holders of the Preferred

            Stock, if entitled by law to vote on any such increase or decrease,

            shall not be entitled to vote separately as a class or series of a

            class thereon.



                  (f) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the Preferred

            Stock as set forth in any resolution or resolutions of the Board of

            Directors providing for the initial issue of one or more series of

            Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to

            receive such dividends, whether payable in cash, stock or otherwise,

            as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors to be

            paid thereon out of any fund legally available therefor, and the

            Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such

            dividend.



                 (g) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,

            dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation, after

            distribution in full of the preferential amounts required to be

            distributed to the holders of each series of Preferred Stock then

            outstanding including the amount of any cumulated but unpaid

            dividends, if any, if a preference shall then attach thereto, the

            holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all of the

            remaining assets of the Corporation, tangible and intangible,



                                       4

            of whatever kind available for distribution to stockholders, ratably

            respectively.



                  FIFTH: Intentionally Omitted.



                  SIXTH: Directors; Election and Classification.



                  (h) Members of the Board of Directors may be elected either by

                  (i) The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than

            three (3) members, such number to be fixed initially by the

            incorporator and subject to change thereafter from time to time by

            action of the stockholders or by action of the Board. The Board

            shall be divided into three classes. The number of directors of the

            first class shall equal one third (1/3) of the total of the number

            of directors thus determined (or the nearest whole number thereto);

            the number of directors of the second class shall equal the number

            of directors of the first class; and the number of directors of the

            third class shall equal said total number of directors minus the

            aggregate number of directors of the first and second classes. At

            the election of the first Board, the class of each of the members

            then elected shall be designated. The term of office of those

            members then designated as the first class shall expire at the

            annual meeting of shareholders next ensuing, that of the members

            designated as the second class at the annual meeting of shareholders

            one year thereafter, and that of the members designated as the third

            class at the annual meeting of shareholders two years thereafter. At

            each annual meeting of the shareholders held after the election and

            classification of the first Board, directors shall be elected for a

            full term of three (3) years to succeed those members whose terms

            then expire.



                  SEVENTH: Adoption, Amendment and/or Repeal of By-Laws. The

            Board of Directors may from time to time (after adoption by the

            undersigned of the original by-laws of the Corporation) adopt, amend

SCHEDULE I



# Exhibit A to Article 3



FORM  

OF  

CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION, PREFERENCES, RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS  

OF  

SERIES B JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK  

OF  

PLEXUS CORP.



(Pursuant to Section 180.06022 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law)



1\. Designation and Amount. There is hereby created a series of Preferred

Stock that shall be designated as Series B Junior Participating Preferred

Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Series B Preferred Stock), and the

number of shares constituting such series shall be 2,000,000. Such number of

shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors;

provided that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series B

Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding

plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of

outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any

outstanding securities issued by the Corporation into Series B Preferred

Stock.



2\. Dividends and Distributions.



|  (A) The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in preference to the

holders of shares of Common Stock and of any other junior stock, shall be

entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of

funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash

on the first business days of January, April, July and October in each year

(each such date being referred to herein as a Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the

first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock,

in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of

(i) $1.00 or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set

forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100

times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all noncash

dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of

Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the

immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the

first Quarterly Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or

fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation

shall at any time after the close of business on August 28, 2008 (the Rights

Declaration Date) (a) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares

of Common Stock, (b) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (c) combine

the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each

such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock

were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the

preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction

the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that are

outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the

number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to

such event.  

---|---  

  



-1- 



* * *



|  (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series

B Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it

declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend

payable in shares of Common Stock); provided  that, in the event no dividend

or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period

between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series B Preferred

Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend

Payment Date.  

---|---  

  

|  (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares

of Series B Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next

preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, unless

the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall

begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of

issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date

for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock

entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend

Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue

and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but

unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of

Series B Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such

dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated

pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time

outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the

determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to

receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record

date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment

thereof.  

---|---  

  



3\. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall

have the following voting rights:



|  (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each

share of Series B Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100

votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the

Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any

dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a

subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of

Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend

in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common

Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders

of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such

event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator

of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that are outstanding

immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.  

---|---  

  

|  (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other resolution of the

Board of Directors creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock,

or by law, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the holders

of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters

submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Corporation.  

---|---  

  



-2- 



* * *



|  (C) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall

have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except

to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set

forth herein) for taking any corporate action.  

---|---  

  



4\. Certain Restrictions.



|  (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions

payable on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in

arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and

distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series B Preferred Stock

outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:  

---|---  

  

|  (i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem

or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking

junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)

to the Series B Preferred Stock;  

---|---  

  

|  (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any

shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon

liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series B Preferred Stock,

except dividends paid ratably on the Series B Preferred Stock and all such

parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the

total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;  

---|---  

  

|  (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of

any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

dissolution or winding up) with the Series B Preferred Stock, provided that

the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares

of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the

Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with (both as to dividends or

upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) the Series B Preferred Stock; or  

---|---  

  

|  (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series B

Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series B

Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or

by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of

such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of

the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences

of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will

result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.  

---|---  

  



-3- 



* * *



|  (B) The Corporation shall not permit any corporation of which an amount of

voting securities sufficient to elect at least a majority of the directors of

such corporation is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the

Corporation or otherwise controlled by the Corporation to purchase or

otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation

unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase

or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.  

---|---  

  



5\. Reacquired Shares. All shares of Series B Preferred Stock that shall at

any time have been reacquired by the Corporation shall, after such

reacquisition, have the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred

Stock of the Corporation, without designation as to series, and may be

reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by

resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions

and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.



6\. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation, dissolution

or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (A) to the

holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon

liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B Preferred Stock

unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall

have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid

dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of

such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock

shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the

provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the

aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common

Stock, or (B) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as

to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series B

Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series B Preferred

Stock and all other such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to

which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation,

dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time

declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common

Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the

outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by

payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser

number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount

to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled

immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (A) of the

preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction

the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



7\. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any

consolidation, merger, combination, share exchange or other transaction in

which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock

or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the

shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly

exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for

adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of

stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the

case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or

exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights

Declaration Date (A) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of

Common Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (C) combine the

outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in

each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to

the exchange or change of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted

by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number

of shares of Common Stock that are outstanding immediately after such event

and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



-4- 



* * *



8\. No Redemption. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be

redeemable.



9\. Amendment. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, prior to

such time as shares of Series B Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding,

the Board of Directors may modify, amend, alter or revoke any of the number of

shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the powers, preferences or special rights

of the Series B Preferred Stock or the other terms of the Series B Preferred

Stock. From and after such time as shares of Series B Preferred Stock are

issued and outstanding, the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the

Corporation shall not be amended in any manner that would materially alter or

change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series B Preferred

Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the

holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred

Stock, voting together as a single class.



10\. Fractional Shares. Series B Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of

a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holders

fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate

in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of

Series B Preferred Stock.

number of directors and any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from

death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause shall be filled

proper reserves may also be carried.



  



(e)This corporation may purchase, hold, sell and transfer shares of its own

capital stock, but shall not use its funds or property for the purchase of its

own shares of capital stock when such use would cause any impairment of the

capital of this corporation, subject always to the right of this corporation

to reduce its capital or to redeem any preferred or special shares out of

capital as permitted by law. Shares of its own capital stock belonging to this

corporation shall not be voted upon directly or indirectly. The purchase,

acquisition or holding by this corporation of shares of its own capital stock

shall not be deemed to constitute the retirement of such shares or a reduction

of capital except as such shares are formally retired or the capital is

formally reduced in accordance with the provisions of law therefor.

(f)Nothing in this certificate of incorporation shall be deemed to prohibit

the reissue of any shares of capital stock of this corporation retired or

reduced upon or in connection with any reduction of capital, but upon the

filing and recording of the certificate of reduction such shares shall have

the status of authorized and unissued shares of the class of stock to which

such shares belong, if and to the extent permitted by law. So far as permitted

by law the stockholders or board of directors authorizing or effectuating any

reduction of capital may determine the manner in which such reduction shall be

effected and the extent, if any, to which any assets shall be distributed to

stockholders, and except as and to the extent that such a distribution is so

authorized or provided for, no stockholder shall be entitled to demand any

distribution of assets in connection with or as the result of any reduction of

capital.



  



(g)The board of directors may from time to time determine whether and to what

extent and at what times and places and under what conditions and regulations

the accounts and books and papers of this corporation, or any of them, shall

be open to the inspection of the stockholders, and no stockholder shall have

any right to inspect any account, book or document of this corporation, except

as and to the extent expressly provided by law with reference to the right of

stockholders to examine the original or duplicate stock ledger, or as

otherwise expressly provided by law, or except as expressly authorized by

resolution of the board of directors.



  



(h)The board of directors shall have the power to fix from time to time the

compensation of its members. No person shall be disqualified from holding any

office by reason of any interest. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, any

director, officer or stockholder of this corporation individually, or any

individual having any interest in any concern which is a stockholder of this

corporation, or any concern in which any such directors, officers,

stockholders or individuals have any interest, may be a party to, or may be

pecuniarily or otherwise interested in, any contract, transaction or other act

of this corporation, and



  



|  

---|---  

  

(i)



|



such contract, transaction or act shall not be in any way invalidated or

otherwise affected by that fact;  

  

  



|  

---|---

corporation for any profit or benefit realized through any such contract,

transaction or act; and  

  

  



|  

---|---  

  

(iii)



|



any such director of this corporation may be counted in determining the

existence of a quorum at any meeting of the board of directors or of any

committee thereof which shall authorize any such contract, transaction or act,

and may vote to authorize the same,  

  

  



provided, however, that any contract, transaction or act in which any director

or officer of this corporation is so interested individually or as a director,

officer, trustee or member of any concern which is not a subsidiary or

affiliate of this corporation, or in which any directors or



  



\- 8 -



-



* * *



  



officers, respectively, are so interested as holders, collectively, of a

majority of shares of capital stock or other beneficial interest at the time

outstanding in any concern which is not a subsidiary or affiliate of this

corporation, shall be duly authorized or ratified by a majority of the board

of directors who are not so interested and to whom the nature of such interest

has been disclosed.



  



With respect to the matters herein contained,



  



|  

---|---  

  

(a)



|



the word “interest” shall include personal interest and interest as a

director, officer, stockholder, shareholder, trustee, member or beneficiary of

any concern;  

  

  



|  

---|---  

  

(b)



|



the word “concern” shall mean any corporation, association, trust,

partnership, firm, person or other entity other than this corporation; and  

  

  



|  

---|---

|



the phrase “subsidiary or affiliate” shall mean a concern in which a majority

of the directors, trustees, partners or controlling persons are elected or

appointed by the directors of this corporation, or are constituted of the

directors or officers of this corporation.  

  

  



To the extent permitted by law, the authorizing or ratifying vote of a

majority in interest of each class of the capital stock of this corporation

outstanding and entitled to vote for directors at an annual meeting or a

special meeting duly called for the purpose (whether such vote is passed

before or after judgment rendered in a suit with respect to such contract,

transaction or act) shall validate any contract, transaction or act of this

corporation, or of the board of directors or any committee thereof, with

regard to all stockholders of this corporation, whether or not of record at

the time of such vote, and with regard to all creditors and other claimants

under this corporation, provided, however, that with respect to the

authorization or ratification of contracts, transactions or acts in which any

of the directors, officers or stockholders of this corporation have an

interest, the nature of such contracts, transactions or acts and the interest

of any director, officer or stockholder therein shall be summarized in the

notice of any such annual or special meeting, or in a statement or letter

accompanying such notice, and shall be fully disclosed at any such meeting,

and provided also that stockholders so interested may vote at any such

meeting, and provided further that any failure of the stockholders to

authorize or ratify such contract, transaction or act shall not be deemed in

any way to invalidate the same or to deprive this corporation, its directors,

officers or employees of its or their right to proceed with such contract,

transaction or act.



  



No contract, transaction or act shall be avoided by reason of any provision of

this clause (h) which would be valid but for those provisions.



  



(i) The Corporation shall indemnify each person who is or was a director or

officer of this Corporation against expenses (including attorney’s fees),

judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the maximum extent

permitted from time to time under the General Corporation Law of the State of

Delaware. Such indemnification shall not be exclusive of other indemnification

rights arising under any by-law, agreement, vote of directors or



  



\- 9 -



-



* * *



  



stockholders or otherwise and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and

legal representatives of such person.



  



(j)[omitted].



  



(k)Stockholder Action. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the

stockholders of the Corporation, or any class or series thereof, must be

effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may

not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. Except as otherwise

required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or

series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or

upon liquidation, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be

called only by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board of

Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board

of Directors.



  



(l)[omitted].



  



(m) A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the

Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary

duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director’s

duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or

omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a

knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General

Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived

an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is

amended after approval by the stockholders of this provision to authorize

corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of

directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be

eliminated or limited to the full extent permitted by the Delaware General

Corporation Law, as so amended.



  



Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders of

the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a

director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or

modification.

incorporation, this corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change,

add to or repeal any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation,

OF



AMERON INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION



  



  



AMERON INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under

the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby certifies as follows:



  



1\. The name of the corporation is AMERON INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, was

originally incorporated under the name AMERON, INC. and the original

Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation was filed with the Secretary

of State of the State of Delaware on February 10, 1986.



  



2\. Pursuant to Section 245 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”),

this Restated Certificate of Incorporation restates and integrates the

provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation.



  



3\. This Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted by the

Board of Directors of the corporation in accordance with Section 245 of the

DGCL.



  



4\. The text of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation as heretofore

amended or supplemented is hereby restated to read in its entirety as follows:  



  



FIRST: The name of this corporation is: Ameron International Corporation.  



  



SECOND:  The address of the Corporation’s registered office in the State of

Delaware is Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New

Castle County, Delaware 19801. The name of its registered agent at such

address is The Corporation Trust Company.  



  



THIRD: The purpose of the corporation is to engage in any lawful act or

activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation

Law of Delaware.  



  



FOURTH: 1. The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall

have authority to issue is Twenty-Five Million (25,000,000), consisting of

Twenty-Four Million (24,000,000) shares of Common Stock, par value Two Dollars

and 50/100 ($2.50) per share (the ""Common Stock""), and One Million (1,000,000)

shares of Preferred Stock, par value One Dollar ($1.00) per share (the

""Preferred Stock"").



* * *



2\. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more

classes or series, each of which class or series shall have such distinctive

designation or title as shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors

of the Corporation (the ""Board of Directors"") prior to the issuance of any

shares thereof. Each such class or series of Preferred Stock shall have such

voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such preferences and

relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such

qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in

such resolution providing for the issuance of such class or series of

Preferred Stock as may be adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors

prior to the issuance of any shares thereof pursuant to the authority hereby

expressly vested in it, all in accordance with the laws of the State of

Delaware. The Board of Directors is further authorized to increase or decrease

(but not below the number of shares of such class or series then outstanding)

the number of shares of any class or series subsequent to the issuance of

shares of that class or series.



  



FIFTH: New bylaws may be adopted or the bylaws may be amended or repealed by a

vote of eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding stock of the corporation

entitled to vote thereon. Bylaws may also be adopted, amended or repealed by

the Board of Directors as provided or permitted by law; however, any bylaw

amendment adopted by the Board of Directors increasing or reducing the

authorized number of directors shall require a resolution adopted by the

affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the directors.  



  



SIXTH: The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of

Directors of the corporation shall be specified in the bylaws of the

corporation, subject to the provisions of Article FIFTH hereof and this

Article SIXTH. The board is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and

Class III. Such classes shall be as nearly equal in number of directors as

possible. Each director shall serve for a term ending on the third annual

meeting following the annual meeting at which such director was elected;

provided, however, that the directors first elected to Class I shall serve for

a term ending at the annual meeting to be held in 1987, the directors first

elected to Class II shall serve for a term ending at the annual meeting to be

held in 1988, and the directors first elected to Class III shall serve for a

term ending at the annual meeting to be held in 1989\. The foregoing

notwithstanding, each director shall serve until his successor shall have been

duly elected and qualified, unless he shall resign, become disqualified,

disabled or shall otherwise be removed.



  



At each annual election, the directors chosen to succeed those whose terms

then expire shall be of the same class as the directors they succeed, unless,

by reason of any intervening changes in the authorized number of directors the

Board shall designate one or more directorships whose term then expires as

directorships of another class in order more nearly to achieve equality of

number of directors among the classes.



  



Notwithstanding the rule that the three classes shall be as nearly equal in

number of directors as possible, in the event of any change in the authorized

number of directors each director then continuing to serve as such shall

nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he is a member until

the expiration of his current term, or his prior death, resignation or

removal.



2



* * *



  



In any election of directors of the Corporation, a holder of any class or

series of stock then entitled to vote in such election shall be entitled to as

many votes as shall equal (i) the number of votes which (except for this

provision as to cumulative voting) he would be entitled to cast for the

election of directors with respect to his shares of stock multiplied by (ii)

the number of directors to be elected in the election in which his class or

series of shares is entitled to vote, and each stockholder may cast all of

such votes for a single director or for any two or more of them as he may see

fit.  



  



SEVENTH: Notwithstanding any other vote which may be required under applicable

law, and in addition thereto, the affirmative vote of holders of not less than

eighty percent (80%) of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of

voting stock of this corporation shall be required to approve: (a) any merger

(other than a merger with a 90% stockholder of this Corporation effected in

accordance with Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law),

consolidation, combination or reorganization of this corporation or any of its

subsidiaries with any other corporation if such other corporation is a

Substantial Stockholder (as defined below) or an Associate (as defined below)

of a Substantial Stockholder, or (b) the sale, lease or exchange by this

corporation or any of its subsidiaries of all or a Substantial Part (as

defined below) of its assets to or with a Substantial Stockholder or an

Associate thereof, or (c) the issuance or delivery of any stock or other

securities of this corporation or any of its subsidiaries in exchange or

payment for any cash or other properties or assets of such Substantial

Stockholder or Associate thereof or securities of such Substantial Stockholder

or Associate thereof, or (d) any reverse stock split of, or exchange of

securities, cash or other properties or assets for, any outstanding securities

of this corporation or any of its subsidiaries or liquidation or dissolution

of this Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, in any such case in which a

Substantial Stockholder or an Associate thereof receives or retains any

securities, cash or other properties or assets whether or not different from

those received or retained by any holder of securities of the same class as

held by such Substantial Stockholder or Associate thereof; provided, however,

that the foregoing shall not apply to any such merger, consolidation,

combination, reorganization, sale, lease or exchange, or for issuance or

delivery of stock or other securities, or reverse stock split, exchange,

liquidation or dissolution which is approved by resolution adopted by a

majority of the Continuing Directors (as defined below) of this corporation,

nor shall it apply to any such transaction solely between this corporation and

another corporation controlled by this corporation and none of the securities

of which is owned before or after such transaction directly or indirectly by a

of Directors acting by majority vote shall have the exclusive power and duty

to determine, on the basis of information known to them after reasonable

inquiry, (i) whether a person is a Substantial Stockholder, (ii) whether a

person is an Affiliate or Associate of a Substantial Stockholder, (iii)

whether a person is a Continuing Director and (iv) whether a portion of the

to any and all other requirements for such liability, such person (i) shall

have breached such person's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its

stockholders, (ii) in acting or in failing to act, shall not have acted in

good faith or shall have acted in a manner involving intentional misconduct or

a knowing violation of law or (iii) shall have derived an improper personal

benefit from the transaction in respect of which such breach of fiduciary duty

shall eliminate or reduce the effect of Section 1 of this Article TENTH in

respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that,

but for Section 1 of this Article TENTH would accrue or arise, prior to such

amendment or repeal. If the Delaware Corporation Law is amended after approval

by the stockholders of this Article TENTH to authorize corporate action

further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the

liability of the director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to

the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so

amended from time to time.



5



* * *



2\. (i) Each person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a

party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,

whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a

""proceeding""), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person of whom

such person is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of

the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a

director or officer of another corporation or in any capacity with respect to

an employee benefit plan maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, shall be

indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent

permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or

may hereafter be amended, against all expenses, liabilities and losses

(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes pursuant to the

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or penalties and amounts paid

or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in

connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person

who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to

the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided,

however, that, except as provided in paragraph (ii) hereof, the Corporation

shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a

proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding

(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract

right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses

incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition;

provided however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law so requires,

the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her

capacity as a director or officer (and not in any any other capacity in which

service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer,

including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance

of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to

the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or

officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined

that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this

Section or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its Board of

Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation

with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors

and officers.



  



(ii) If a claim under paragraph (i) of this Section is not paid in full by the

Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the

Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the

Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in

whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense

of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other

than action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any

proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking,

if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant

has not met the standard of conduct required under Delaware General

Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount

claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.

Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,

independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination

prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant

is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable

standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an

actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,

independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met

such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or

create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of

conduct.



6



* * *



  



(iii) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in

defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this

Section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or

hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of

Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested

directors or otherwise.



  



(iv) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself

ARTICLE V



Authorized Capital Stock



Section 1. Classes. The Corporation shall be authorized to issue two classes

of shares of stock to be designated, respectively, ""Common Stock"" and

""Preferred Stock""; the total number of shares which the Corporation shall have

authority to issue is one hundred fifty two million (152,000,000); the total

number of shares of Common Stock shall be one hundred fifty million

(150,000,000) and each such share shall have an ascribed value of $1.50; the

total number of shares of Preferred Stock shall be two million (2,000,000) and

each such share shall have no ascribed or par value.



Section 2. Preferred Stock. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time

to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Corporation is

hereby authorized to fix the designations and powers, preferences and

relative, participating, optional or other rights, if any, and qualifications,

limitations or other restrictions thereof, including, without limitation,

dividend rights and preferences over dividend on Common Stock or any series of

Preferred Stock, the dividend rate (and whether dividends are cumulative),

conversion rights, if any, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption

(including sinking fund provisions, if any), redemption price and liquidation

preferences of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock and the number of

shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof, of any of

them; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series

subsequent to the issue of shares of that series, but not below the number of

shares of such series then outstanding.



Section 3. Preemptive Rights. The shareholders of the Corporation shall have

no preemptive rights to acquire additional shares issued by the Corporation,

except as may be provided to holders as specified in any Certificate of

Designation creating such series or class of Preferred Stock as may

hereinafter be adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.



ARTICLE VI



Directors



The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of the

Corporation shall be at least that number required by the Washington Business

Corporation Act, as the same may be amended from time to time, to classify the

Board and such number shall be specified in the Bylaws of the Corporation, as

the same may be amended from time to time.



The Board shall be divided into three classes: Class I Directors, Class II

Directors and Class III Directors. Each such class of directors shall be as

nearly equal in number of directors as possible. Each director shall serve for

a term ending at the third annual shareholders' meeting following the annual

meeting at which such director was elected; provided, however, that the

directors first elected as Class I Directors shall serve for a term ending at

the annual meeting to be held in the year following the first election of

directors by classes, the directors first elected as Class II Directors shall

serve for a term ending at the annual meeting to be held in the second year

following the first election of directors by classes and the directors first

elected as Class III Directors shall serve for a term ending at the annual

meeting to be held in the third year following the first election of directors

by classes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each director shall serve until his

successor shall have been elected and qualified or until his earlier death,

resignation or removal.



At each annual election, the directors chosen to succeed those whose terms

then expire shall be identified as being of the same class as the directors

they succeed, unless, by reason of any intervening changes in the authorized

number of directors, the Board shall designate one or more directorships whose

terms then expire as directorships of another class in order to more nearly to

achieve equality in the number of directors among the classes. When the Board

fills a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a

director, the director chosen to fill that vacancy shall be of the same class

as the director he succeeds, unless, by reason of any previous changes in the

authorized number of directors, the Board shall designate the vacant

directorship as a directorship of another class in order more nearly to

achieve equality in the number of directors among the classes.



Notwithstanding the rule that the three classes shall be as nearly equal in

number of directors as possible, upon any change in the authorized number of

directors, each director then continuing to serve as such will nevertheless

continue as a director of the class of which he is a member, until the

expiration of his current term or his earlier death, resignation or removal.

If there are any newly created directorships or vacancies on the Board, the

Board shall allocate any such directorship or vacancy to that of the available

classes of directors which term of office is due to expire at the earliest

dated following such allocation.



Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of

directors and any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death,

resignation, removal or other cause shall be filled by the affirmative vote of

a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a

quorum of the Board of Directors. Any director elected in accordance with the

preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the

class of directors in which the new directorship was created or in which the

vacancy occurred and thereafter until such director's successor shall have

been elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors

constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent

director.



At any meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose, the entire

Board of Directors, or any member thereof, may be removed from office at any

time, but only (1) for Cause and (2) by the affirmative vote of the holders of

the majority of shares then entitled to vote at an election of such directors.

For purposes of this Article VI, ""Cause"" shall be limited to (i) action by a

director involving willful malfeasance having a material adverse effect on the

Corporation or (ii) a director being convicted of a felony; provided that any

action by a director shall not constitute ""Cause"" if, in good faith, he

believed such action to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the

Corporation, or if a director shall be entitled, under applicable law or the

Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation, to be indemnified with

respect to such action.



The first directors of the Corporation are ten (10) in number and their names,

class and addresses are:

ARTICLE VIII



Voting Rights



Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock

outstanding, at each election of directors, every shareholder entitled to vote

at such election has the right to vote in person or by proxy the number of

shares of stock held by him for as many persons as there are directors to be

elected. No cumulative voting for directors shall be permitted.



ARTICLE IX



Limitation on Liability of Directors



No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation

or its shareholders for monetary damages for his or her conduct as a director,

except for (1) acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a

knowing violation of law by the director, (2) approval of distributions or

loans in violation of RCW 23A.08.450, or (3) any transaction from which the

director will personally receive a benefit in money, property or services to

which the director is not legally entitled. If the Washington Business

Corporation Act is hereafter amended to authorize corporate action further

eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the

liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to

the fullest extent permitted by the Washington Business Corporation Act, as so

amended. Any amendment to or repeal of this Article shall not adversely affect

any right or protection of a director of the Corporation for or with respect

to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or

repeal.



ARTICLE X



Amendment of Articles



Except as set forth below, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter,

change or repeal any provision contained in these Articles of Incorporation in

the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers

conferred herein on shareholders and directors are subject to this reserved

power.



Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation or the

Bylaws of this Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser

percentage may be permitted by law) no amendment to these Articles of

Incorporation which reduces to less than two-thirds the percentage of votes

necessary to approve a merger, share exchange, sale of assets other than in

the regular course of business or dissolution of the Corporation shall be

effective unless the amendment is approved by each voting group entitled to

vote separately by two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the

proposed action by that voting group, given at a shareholders' meeting duly

called for that purpose. Further, this Article X shall not be amended,

altered, changed or repealed unless approved by each voting group entitled to

vote separately by two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast by that

voting group, given at a shareholders' meeting duly called for that purpose.



As used herein, the term ""voting group"" shall mean all shares of one or more

classes or series of equity securities of the Corporation that under the

Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or by law are entitled to vote

together and be counted together collectively on a matter at a meeting of

shareholders of the Corporation.

DIVISION I-A



SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED SHARES



SECTION 1\. There is established hereby a series of Serial Preferred Shares

that shall be designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares

(hereinafter sometimes called this Series or the Series A Junior

Participating Preferred Shares) and that shall have the terms set forth in

this Division I-A.



Page 2



* * *



SECTION 2\. The number of shares of this Series shall be 1,500,000.



SECTION 3\. a) The holders of record of Series A Junior Participating

Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the

Directors in accordance with the terms hereof, out of funds legally available

for the purpose, cumulative quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first

day of March, June, September, and December in each year (each such date being

referred to herein as a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date), commencing on the

first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a Series A

Junior Participating Preferred Share or fraction of a Series A Junior

Participating Preferred Share. Such quarterly dividend payments shall be in an

amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i)

$1.00 per share or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter

set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends,

plus 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-

cash dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend payable in Common

Shares, or a subdivision of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification

or otherwise)), declared on the Common Shares since the immediately preceding

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any Series A Junior

Participating Preferred Share or fraction of a Series A Junior Participating

Preferred Share. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any

dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect a

subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares

(by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common

Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such

case the amount to which holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred

Shares were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the

preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction

the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately

after such event and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares

that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding Series A

Junior Participating Preferred Shares from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date

next preceding the date of issue of such Series A Junior Participating

Preferred Shares, unless (i) the date of issue of such shares is prior to the

record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case

dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such

shares, or (ii) the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a

date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of

Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares entitled to receive a quarterly

dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which

events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear

interest. No dividends shall be paid upon or declared and set apart for any

Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares for any dividend period unless

at the same time a dividend for the same dividend period, ratably in

proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor, shall be

paid upon or declared and set apart for all Serial Preferred Shares of all

series then outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend. The Directors

may fix a record date for the determination of holders of Series A Junior

Participating Preferred Shares entitled to receive payment of a dividend or

distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 40 days

prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.



Page 3



* * *



SECTION 4\. The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares are not

redeemable.



SECTION 5\. (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,

dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company (hereinafter referred

to as a Liquidation), no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares

of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation) to the

Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares, unless, prior thereto, the

holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall have received

at least an amount per share equal to 100 times the then applicable Purchase

Price as defined in the Rights Agreement dated as of May 20, 2009, between the

Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as the same may be from time to

time amended in accordance with its terms (which Purchase Price is $140.00 as

of May 20, 2009), subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the

Rights Agreement, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and

distributions thereon, whether or not earned or declared, to the date of such

payment, provided that the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred

Shares shall be entitled to receive at least an aggregate amount per share,

subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100

times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of Common

Shares (the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares Liquidation

Preference).



(b) In the event, however, that the net assets of the Company are not

sufficient to pay in full the amount of the Series A Junior Participating

Preferred Shares Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all

other series of Serial Preferred Shares, if any, which rank on a parity with

the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares as to distribution of

assets in Liquidation, all shares of this Series and of such other series of

Serial Preferred Shares shall share ratably in the distribution of assets (or

proceeds thereof) in Liquidation in proportion to the full amounts to which

they are respectively entitled.



(c) In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on

the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect a subdivision or

combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by

reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Shares)

into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such case the

amount to which holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares were

entitled immediately prior to such event pursuant to the proviso set forth in

paragraph (a) above, shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a

fraction the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding

immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



(d) The merger or consolidation of the Company into or with any other

corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the sale,

lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the property or business of

the Company, shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation for the purpose of this

Section 5.



SECTION 6\. The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall not be

convertible into Common Shares.

DIVISION II

election or removal of directors.

matters (x) are required under the Ohio Revised Code, any provisions of these

Amended Articles of Incorporation or the Regulations of the Company or

applicable stock exchange rules, to be submitted to the shareholders for their

vote, consent, waiver or other action or (y) are submitted or presented to the

shareholders for their vote, consent waiver or other action: (1) any matter

or expand the matters to which this Section 2(a) applies, (3) any proposal or

other action to be taken by the shareholders of the Company, whether or not

proposed by the shareholders of the Company, and whether proposed by authority

of the Board of Directors or otherwise, relating to the Amended and Restated

to time pursuant to its terms, or any successor plan, (4) any matter relating

to any stock option plan, stock purchase plan, executive compensation plan,

executive benefit plan, or other similar plan, arrangement or agreement, (5)

adoption of any agreement or plan of or for the merger, consolidation, or

majority share acquisition of the Company or any subsidiary with or into any

other person, whether domestic or foreign, corporate, or noncorporate, or the

authorization of the lease, sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of

all, or substantially all, of the Companys assets, (6) any matter submitted

to the shareholders pursuant to Article Fifth or Article Seventh of these

Amended Articles of Incorporation, as they may be further amended, or any

issuance of shares of the Company for which shareholder approval is required

Board of Directors determines is required or appropriate to be submitted to

the shareholders under the Ohio Revised Code or applicable stock exchange

rules, except that:



(i) no holder of Common Shares shall be entitled to exercise more than one

vote on any such matter in respect of any Common Share with respect to which

there has been a change in beneficial ownership following the Effective Time

of the Merger (as such terms are defined in the Transaction Agreement, dated

as of June 4, 2008, as it may be amended from time to time (the Transaction

Agreement), by and among The Procter & Gamble Company, The Folgers Coffee

Company, Moon Merger Sub, Inc. and the Company) and during the four years

immediately preceding the date on which a determination is made of the

shareholders who are entitled to take any such action; and



Page 5



* * *



(ii) no holder shall be entitled to exercise more than one vote on any such

matter in respect of any Common Share if the aggregate voting power such

holder otherwise would be entitled to exercise as of the date of such a

determination (disregarding the voting power of any Common Shares held by such

holder on August 20, 1985 or acquired by such holder in a transaction not

involving any change in beneficial ownership by reason of Section 2(c) of this

Division II) would constitute one-fifth or more of the voting power of the

Company and the holders of the Common Shares have not authorized the ownership

of Common Shares by such person as and to the extent contemplated by Article

Seventh hereof.



(b) A change in beneficial ownership of an outstanding Common Share shall be

deemed to have occurred whenever a change occurs in any person or group of

persons who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement,

understanding, relationship or otherwise has or shares (1) voting power, which

includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of such Common Share, (2)

investment power, which includes the power to direct the sale or other

disposition of such Common Share, (3) the right to receive or retain the

proceeds of any sale or other disposition of such Common Share, or (4) the

right to receive any distributions, including cash dividends, in respect of

such Common Share.



(A) In the absence of proof to the contrary provided in accordance with the

procedures referred to in Section 2(d) of this Division II, a change in

beneficial ownership shall be deemed to have occurred whenever a Common Share

is transferred of record into the name of any other person.



(B) In the case of a Common Share held of record in the name of a corporation,

general partnership, limited partnership, voting trustee, bank, trust company,

broker, nominee or clearing agency, if it has not been established pursuant to

the procedures referred to in Section 2(d) of this Division II that there has

been no change in the person or persons who direct the exercise of the rights

referred to in clauses (b)(1) through (b)(4) of Section 2 of this Division II

with respect to such Common Share during the period of four years immediately

preceding the date on which a determination is made of the shareholders who

are entitled to take any action, then a change in beneficial ownership shall

be deemed to have occurred during such period.



(C) In the case of a Common Share held of record in the name of any person as

a trustee, agent, guardian or custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act

as in effect in any state, a change in beneficial ownership shall be deemed to

have occurred whenever there is a change in the beneficiary of such trust, the

principal of such agent, the ward of such guardian or the minor for whom such

custodian is acting or in such trustee, agent, guardian or custodian.



(D) In the case of Common Shares beneficially owned by a person or group of

persons who, after acquiring directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership

of five percent of the outstanding Common Shares, failed to notify the Company

of such ownership, a change in beneficial ownership of such Common Shares

shall be deemed to occur on each day while such failure continues.



Page 6



* * *



(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2 of this Division II to the

contrary, no change in beneficial ownership shall be deemed to have occurred

solely as a result of:



(1) any event that occurred prior to August 20, 1985 or pursuant to the terms

of any contract (other than a contract for the purchase and sale of Common

Shares contemplating prompt settlement), including contracts providing for

options, rights of first refusal and similar arrangements in existence on such

date to which any holder of Common Shares is a party;



(2) any transfer of any interest in a Common Share pursuant to a bequest or

inheritance, by operation of law upon the death of any individual, or by any

other transfer without valuable consideration, including a gift that is made

in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this Article Fourth;



(3) any change in the beneficiary of any trust, or any distribution of a

Common Share from trust, by reason of the birth, death, marriage or divorce of

any natural person, the adoption of any natural person prior to age 18 or the

passage of a given period of time or the attainment by any natural person of a

specific age, or the creation or termination of any guardianship or custodial

arrangement;



(4) any appointment of a successor trustee, agent, guardian or custodian with

respect to a Common Share if neither such successor has nor its predecessor

had the power to vote or to dispose of such Common Share without further

instructions from others;



(5) any change in the person to whom dividends or other distributions in

respect of a Common Share are to be paid pursuant to the issuance or

modification of a revocable dividend payment order; or



(6) any issuance of a Common Share by the Company or any transfer by the

Company of a Common Share held in treasury unless otherwise determined by the

Board of Directors at the time of authorizing such issuance, or transfer,

including without limitation those Common Shares issued pursuant to the

Transaction Agreement.



(d) For purposes of Section 2 of this Division II, all determinations

concerning changes in beneficial ownership, or the absence of any such change,

shall be made by the Company or, at any time when a transfer agent is acting

with respect to the Common Shares, by such transfer agent on the Companys

behalf. Written procedures designed to facilitate such determinations shall be

established by the Company and refined from time to time. Such procedures

shall provide, among other things, the manner of proof of facts that will be

accepted and the frequency with which such proof may be required to be

renewed. The Company and any transfer agent shall be entitled to rely on all

information concerning beneficial ownership of the Common Shares coming to

their attention from any source and in any manner reasonably deemed by them to

be reliable, but neither the Company nor any transfer agent shall be charged

with any other knowledge concerning the beneficial ownership of the Common

Shares.



Page 7



* * *



(e) In the event of any stock split or stock dividend with respect to the

Common Shares, each Common Share acquired by reason of such split or dividend

shall be deemed to have been beneficially owned by the same person

continuously from the same date as that on which beneficial ownership of the

Common Share, with respect to which such Common Share was distributed, was

acquired.



SECTION 3. No reference to any matter in this Division II shall be deemed to

entitle any shareholder of the Company the right to vote thereon, consent

thereto, grant a waiver or release in respect thereof, or take any other

action with respect thereto.



SECTION 4. Each Common Share, whether at any particular time the holder

thereof is entitled to exercise ten votes or one vote pursuant to Section 2 of

this Division II, shall be identical to all other Common Shares in all

respects, and together the Common Shares shall constitute a single class of

shares of the Company.



FIFTH. (a) Unless the conditions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) of this

paragraph (a) are satisfied, the affirmative vote of the holders of 85% of all

shares of the Company entitled to vote in elections of Directors, considered

for the purposes of this Article Fifth as one class, shall be required for the

adoption or authorization of a business combination (as hereinafter defined)

with any other entity (as hereinafter defined) if, as of the record date for

the determination of shareholders entitled to notice thereof and to vote

thereon, the other entity is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of

more than 30% of the outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote in

elections of Directors, considered for the purposes of this Article Fifth as

one class. The 85% voting requirement set forth in the foregoing sentence

shall not be applicable if:



(1) The cash, or fair market value of other consideration, to be received per

share by holders of Common Shares of the Company in the business combination

is at least an amount equal to (A) the highest per share price paid by the

other entity in acquiring any of its holdings of the Common Shares of the

Company plus (B) the aggregate amount, if any, by which 5% per annum of the

per share price exceeds the aggregate amount of all dividends paid in cash, in

each case since the date on which the other entity acquired the 30% interest;



(2) After the other entity has acquired a 30% interest and prior to the

consummation of the business combination: (A) the other entity shall have

taken steps to ensure that the Companys Board of Directors included at all

times representation by continuing director(s) (as hereinafter defined)

proportionate to the shareholdings of the public holders of Common Shares of

the Company not affiliated with the other entity (with a continuing director

to occupy any resulting fractional board position); (B) the other entity shall

not have acquired any newly issued shares, directly or indirectly, from the

Company (except upon conversion of convertible securities acquired by it prior

to obtaining a 30% interest or as a result of a pro rata share dividend or

share split); and (C) the other entity shall not have acquired any additional

outstanding Common Shares of the Company or securities convertible into Common

Shares except as a part of the transaction that resulted in the other entitys

acquiring its 30% interest;



Page 8



* * *



(3) The other entity shall not have (A) received the benefit, directly or

indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances,

guarantees, pledges, or other financial assistance or tax credits provided by

the Company or (B) made any major change in the Companys business or equity

capital structure without in either case the approval of at least a majority

of all the directors and at least two-thirds of the continuing directors, in

either case prior to the consummation of the business combination; and



(4) A proxy statement responsive to the requirements of the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934 shall have been mailed to public shareholders of the

Company for the purpose of soliciting shareholder approval of the business

combination and shall have contained at the front thereof, in a prominent

place, any recommendations as to the advisability (or inadvisability) of the

business combination that the continuing directors, or any of them, may choose

to state and, if deemed advisable by a majority of the continuing directors,

an opinion of a reputable investment banking firm as to the fairness (or not)

of the terms of the business combination, from the point of view of the

remaining public shareholders of the Company (the investment banking firm to

be selected by a majority of the continuing directors and to be paid a

reasonable fee for their services by the Company upon receipt of the opinion).



The provisions of this Article Fifth shall also apply to a business

combination with any other entity that at any time has been the beneficial

owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 30% of the outstanding shares of

the Company entitled to vote in elections of Directors, considered for the

purposes of this Article Fifth as one class, notwithstanding the fact that the

other entity has reduced its shareholdings below 30% if, as of the record date

for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote on the

business combination, the other entity is an affiliate of the Company (as

hereinafter defined).



(b) As used in this Article Fifth, (1) the term other entity shall include

any corporation, person, or other entity and any other entity with which it or

its affiliate or associate (as defined below) has any agreement,

arrangement, or understanding, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of

acquiring, holding, voting, or disposing of shares of the Company, or that is

its affiliate or associate as those terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 of the

General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

together with the successors and assigns of those persons in any transaction

or series of transactions not involving a public offering of the Companys

shares within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933; (2) another entity

shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of any shares of the Company that

the other entity (as defined above) has the right to acquire pursuant to any

agreement or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants, or options, or

otherwise; (3) the outstanding shares of any class of the Company shall

include shares deemed owned through application of clause (2) above but shall

not include any other shares that may be issuable pursuant to any agreement or

upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants, or options, or otherwise; (4)

the term business combination shall include (A) the sale, exchange, lease,

transfer, or other disposition by the Company of all, or substantially all, of

its assets or business to any other entity, (B) the consolidation of the

Company with or its merger into any other entity, (C) the merger into the

Company of any other entity, and (D) a combination or majority share

acquisition in which the Company is the acquiring corporation (as those

terms are defined in Section 1701.01 of the Ohio Revised Code or any similar

provision hereafter



Page 9

enacted) and its voting shares are issued or transferred to any other entity

or to shareholders of any other entity, and the term business combination

shall also include any agreement, contract, or other arrangement with another

entity providing for any of the transactions described in (A) through (D) of

this clause (4); (5) the term continuing director shall mean either a person

who was a member of the Board of Directors of the Company elected by the

public shareholders prior to the time when the other entity acquired in excess

of 5% of the shares of the Company entitled to vote in the election of

Directors, considered for the purposes of this Article Fifth as one class, or

a person recommended to succeed a continuing director or by a majority of the

continuing directors; and (6), for the purposes of clause (a)(1) of this

Article Fifth, the term other consideration to be received shall mean Common

Shares of the Company retained by its existing public shareholders in the

event of a business combination with the other entity in which the Company is

the surviving corporation.



(c) A majority of the continuing directors shall have the power and duty to

determine for the purposes of this Article Fifth, on the basis of information

known to them, whether (1) the other entity beneficially owns more than 30% of

the outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote in the election of

Directors, (2) another entity is an affiliate or associate (as defined

above) of another, or (3) another entity has an agreement, arrangement, or

understanding with another.



(d) No amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the Company shall amend;

alter, change, or repeal any of the provisions of this Article Fifth unless

the amendment effecting such amendment, alteration, change, or repeal receives

the affirmative vote of the holders of 85% of all shares of the Company

entitled to vote in the election of Directors, considered for the purposes of

this Article Fifth as one class, except that this paragraph (d) shall not

apply to, and the 85% vote shall not be required for, any amendment,

alteration, change, or repeal recommended to the shareholders by the Board of

Directors of the Company if the recommendation has been approved by at least a

majority of all of the directors and by at least two-thirds of the continuing

directors.



(e) Nothing contained in this Article Fifth shall be construed to relieve any

other entity from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.



SIXTH. Section 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code shall not apply to control

share acquisitions of shares of the Company so long as Article Seventh hereof

is in effect.



SEVENTH. The Control Share Acquisition provisions applicable to the shares of

the Company, in lieu of those contained in Section 1701.831 of the Ohio

Revised Code, are set forth in this Article Seventh.



(A) As used in this Article Seventh:



(1) (a) Control Share Acquisition means the acquisition, directly or

indirectly, by any Person (as hereinafter defined) of shares of the Company

(other than in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1)(b) of this

Section (A)) that, when added to all other shares of the Company in respect of

which that person, directly or indirectly, may exercise or direct the exercise

of voting power as provided herein, would entitle such Person, immediately

after the acquisition, directly or indirectly, to exercise or direct the

exercise of the voting power in the election of Directors of the Company of a

number of the



Page 10



* * *



outstanding shares of the Company (as distinguished from the number of votes

exercise of votes without further instruction from others on the proposed

Control Share Acquisition at the meeting of shareholders called under this

less than one-third of such outstanding shares or within a Range higher than

the Range applicable prior to the acquisition;

this Article Seventh;

created in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this Article

Seventh; or



(vi) Pursuant to a merger, consolidation, combination, or majority share

acquisition adopted or authorized by shareholder vote in compliance with the

provisions of Section 1701.78 or 1701.79 of the Ohio Revised Code if the

Company is the surviving or new corporation in the merger or consolidation or

is the acquiring corporation in a combination or majority share acquisition.



The acquisition by any Person of shares of the Company in a manner described

under this paragraph (1)(b) of this Section (A) shall be deemed a Control

Share Acquisition authorized pursuant to this Article Seventh within the Range

applicable after the acquisition, provided, in the case of an acquisition in a

manner described under clause (1)(b)(iv) or (v) of this Section (A), the

transferor of shares to that Person had previously obtained any authorization

of shareholders



Page 11

required under this Article Seventh or under Section 1701.831 of the Ohio

Revised Code in connection with that transferors acquisition of shares of the

Company.



(c) The acquisition of shares of the Company in good faith and not for the

purpose of circumventing this Article Seventh from any Person whose Control

Share Acquisition had previously been authorized by shareholders, or from any

Person whose previous acquisition of shares would have constituted a Control

Share Acquisition but for paragraph (1)(b) of this Section (A), does not

constitute a Control Share Acquisition unless that acquisition entitles the

acquiring Person, directly or indirectly, to exercise or direct the exercise

of voting power in the election of Directors of the Company of a number of

shares in excess of the Range authorized by the shareholders or defined to be

authorized under paragraph (1)(b) of this Section (A).

any of the following persons may exercise or direct the exercise of the voting

power of the Company in the election of Directors;

(b) Any officer of the Company elected or appointed by the Directors,

provided, however, that shares which, as of the record date of any special

meeting held pursuant to this Article Seventh, have been owned beneficially by

such person for four or more years shall not be deemed to be Interested

Shares for purposes of any vote at such meeting;



(c) Any employee of the Company who is also a Director, provided, however,

that shares which, as of the record date of any special meeting held pursuant

to this Article Seventh, have been owned beneficially by such person for four

(2) If any part of this division is held to be illegal or invalid in

application, the illegality or invalidity does not affect any legal and valid

application thereof or any other provision or application of this Article

Seventh that can be given effect without the invalid or illegal provision, and

the parts and applications of this Article Seventh are severable.



(B) Any Person who proposes to make a Control Share Acquisition, or seeks to

exercise one-fifth or more of the voting power of the Company under paragraph

(a) of Division II of Article Fourth hereof, shall deliver an Acquiring Person

Statement to the Companys principal executive offices. The Acquiring Person

Person Statement. If the Acquiring Person so requests in writing at the time

of delivery of the Acquiring Person Statement, the special meeting shall be

held no sooner than thirty days after receipt by the Company of the Acquiring

Person Statement. The special meeting of shareholders shall not be held later

than any other special meeting that is called, after receipt by the Company of

the Acquiring Person Statement, in compliance with Section 1701.76, 1701.78,

1701.79 or 1701.83 of the Ohio Revised Code or this Article Seventh.

(F) As provided in Section 1701.48 of the Ohio Revised Code, no proxy

appointed by or in connection with a shareholder authorization of a Control

Share Acquisition is valid if it (1) provides that it is irrevocable or (2) is

sought, appointed, and received other than (a) in accordance with all

applicable requirements of the laws of the State of Ohio and of the United

States and (b) separate and apart from the sale or purchase, contract or

tender for sale or purchase, or request or invitation for tender for sale of

EIGHTH. No holder of shares of the Company of any class, as such, shall have

any pre-emptive right to purchase or subscribe for shares of the Company, of

any class, or other securities of the Company, of any class, whether now or

hereafter authorized. No holder of shares of the Company of any class, as

such, shall have any right to cumulate the voting power in respect of those

shares in the election of Directors, and the right to cumulate the voting

power of the holder as provided in Section 1701.55 of the Ohio Revised Code is

hereby specifically denied to all holders of shares of any class of the

Company.



NINTH. Subject to the last sentence of this Article NINTH, in an election of

Directors, a candidate shall be elected only if the votes cast for the

candidate exceed the votes cast against the candidate. Abstentions shall not

be counted as votes cast for or against a candidate. Notwithstanding the

foregoing, if the Directors determine that the number of candidates exceeds

the number of Directors to be elected, then in that election, the nominees

receiving the greatest number of votes shall be elected.



TENTH. The Company, by action of its directors and without action by its

shareholders, may purchase its own shares in accordance with the provisions of

Chapter 1701 of the Ohio Revised Code. Such purchases may be made either in

the open market or at public or private sale, in such manner and amounts of

any one class or any combination of classes, from such holder or holders of

outstanding shares of the Company, and at such prices as the directors shall

from time to time determine without regard to differences among the classes in

price and other terms under which shares may be purchased or in relative

number of shares that may be available for purchase.

PREFERENCES, LIMITATION AND RELATIVE RIGHTS OF



CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK.



  



SECTION 4.1. Dividends and Distributions on Cumulative Preferred Stock.



  



Subsection 4.1.1. The holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock of all series

shall be entitled to receive dividends at such rates, upon such conditions and

at such times as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions of the Board

of Directors providing for the issuance thereof and not inconsistent with the

provisions hereof.



* * *



Subsection 4.1.2. No dividend or other distribution, except a dividend payable

solely in Common Stock, shall be paid on Common Stock, and no shares of Common

Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired by the corporation

for a consideration, otherwise than in exchange for or through application of

the proceeds of the sale of other Common Stock, if the payment of such

dividend or distribution on Common Stock, or the making of any such purchase,

redemption or other acquisition of Common Stock, will result in reducing the

Consolidated Net Worth of the corporation below 150% of the aggregate

involuntary liquidation amounts of all outstanding shares of Cumulative

Preferred Stock.



  



Subsection 4.1.3. All dividends on Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be without

priority as between series, shall be paid out of net earnings or any surplus

properly applicable to the payment thereof, shall be cumulative and shall be

paid or set apart before any dividends or other distributions shall be paid or

set apart for Common Stock, provided, however, that dividends may be declared

and paid on Common Stock in Common Stock of the corporation. Any dividends

paid upon the Cumulative Preferred Stock in an amount less than full

cumulative dividends accrued and in arrears upon all Cumulative Preferred

Stock outstanding shall, if more than one series be outstanding, be

distributed among the different series in proportion to the aggregate amounts

which would be distributable to the Cumulative Preferred Stock of each series

if full cumulative dividends were declared and paid thereon.



  



Subsection 4.1.4. The Cumulative Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder

thereof to receive, out of net profits of the corporation or out of any

surplus applicable to the payment of such dividends in each fiscal year as

declared at any time by the Board of Directors, dividends at the rate fixed in

the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to

which the issuance of such Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be authorized. The

dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be cumulative, so that if at

any time the full amount of dividends accrued and in arrears on the Cumulative

Preferred Stock shall not be paid, the deficiency shall be payable before any

dividends or other distributions shall be paid or set apart on the Common

Stock, and before any sums shall be paid or set apart for the redemption of

less than all of the Cumulative Preferred Stock then outstanding. Dividends on

Cumulative Preferred Stock shall accrue from date of issue. Whenever all

dividends accrued and in arrears on Cumulative Preferred Stock shall have been

declared and shall have been paid or set apart, the Board of Directors may

declare dividends on Common Stock out of the remaining net profits of the

corporation, or out of surplus applicable to the payment of such dividends,

subject to the restriction set forth in Subsection 4.1.2 hereof.



  



SECTION 4.2. Issuance of Cumulative Preferred Stock.



  



Subsection 4.2.1. No stock having preference or priority in rights or security

over the Cumulative Preferred Stock may be issued unless first approved by the

affirmative vote of such majority of the Cumulative Preferred Stock then

outstanding as then required by law.



  



Subsection 4.2.2. No Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be issued which, after

giving effect to such issuance, would result in the aggregate involuntary

liquidation amount of all outstanding shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock

exceeding 66-2/3% of Consolidated Net Worth of the corporation.



  



SECTION 4.3. Rights of Holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock on Liquidation.



  



In the event of the voluntary liquidation or winding up of the corporation,

the holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive in full

the fixed voluntary liquidation amount thereof plus accrued dividends thereon,

all as provided in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance

thereof, and no more, before any amount shall be paid to the holders of Common

Stock. In the event of the involuntary liquidation of the corporation, the

holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive in full

the fixed involuntary liquidation amount thereof, plus accrued dividends

thereon, all as provided in the resolution or resolutions providing for the

issuance thereof, and no more, before any amount shall be paid to the holders

of Common Stock. The holders of all series of Cumulative Preferred Stock shall

be entitled to receive all amounts described in the preceding provisions of

this Section 4.3 out of the assets of the corporation, whether from capital,

surplus or earnings. As used in this Section 4.3 “accrued dividends” means, in

respect to each share of Cumulative Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the

fixed dividend rate per annum for each share (without interest thereon), from

the date from which cumulative dividends commenced to accrue in respect of

such share to the date as of which the computation is to be made, less the

aggregate amount (without interest) of all dividends paid thereon or declared

and set aside for payment in respect thereof, whether or not any such

dividends shall have been earned. If, upon any such voluntary or involuntary

liquidation, the assets of the corporation distributable as aforesaid among

the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit

payment to them of the full preferential amounts aforesaid, then the entire

assets of the corporation available for distribution to shareholders shall be

distributed ratably among the holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock in

proportion to the full preferential amounts to which they are respectively

entitled.



* * *



The holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock shall not otherwise be entitled to

participate in any distribution of assets of the corporation which shall be

divided and distributed among the holders of Common Stock according to their

respective rights and preferences. No consolidation or merger of the

corporation with or into another corporation or corporations and no sale by

the corporation of all or substantially all of its assets shall be deemed a

liquidation or winding up of the corporation within the meaning of this

Section 4.3.



  



SECTION 4.4. Voting Rights of Cumulative Preferred Stock.



  



The holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall, together with the holders

of Common Stock (neither the Cumulative Preferred Stock nor the Common Stock

voting as a class), possess full voting rights for the election of directors

and for other purposes, and for such purposes the holders of Cumulative

Preferred Stock shall, subject to the provisions of the Bylaws of the

corporation and of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law relative to the

fixing of the record date, be entitled to one vote for each share held by them

respectively.



  



SECTION 4.5. Directors’ Authority to Establish Series of Cumulative Preferred

Stock.



  



The Cumulative Preferred Stock may be issued in series from time to time, with

such designations, preferences and other rights, qualifications, limitations

or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or

resolutions providing for the issuance of such series and adopted by the Board

of Directors pursuant to the authority hereby given as provided by the

Wisconsin Business Corporation Law and not inconsistent with the provisions

hereof. Without limiting the authority granted to the Board of Directors in

this Section, each series shall have such (a) rate of dividend; (b) price at

and terms and conditions on which shares may be redeemed; (c) amount payable

upon shares in event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation; (d) sinking fund

provisions for the redemption or purchase of shares; and (e) terms and

conditions on which shares may be converted, if the shares of any series are

issued with the privilege of conversion; as shall be stated or expressed in

the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the

issuance thereof.



  



SECTION 4.6. Definitions.



  



Subsection 4.6.1. The term “Consolidated Net Worth” of the corporation shall

mean the Consolidated Net Worth of the corporation and all of its subsidiaries

determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted

accounting principles.



  



Subsection 4.6.2. The term “Subsidiary” shall mean any corporation or

association of which not less than a majority of the capital stock or shares

(having the power in all events to vote for the election of directors or

trustees) is owned and controlled by the corporation either directly or

through another Subsidiary.



  



SECTION 4.7. Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock.



  



Subsection 4.7.1. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be

designated as “Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock” (the “Series

A Preferred Stock”) and the number of shares constituting the Series A

Preferred Stock shall be 100,000. Such number of shares may be increased or

decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that no decrease

shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less

than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved

for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or

upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the corporation

convertible into Series A Preferred Stock.



* * *



Subsection 4.7.2. Dividends and Distributions.



  



(A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of

Cumulative Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking pari passu with the

Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of

Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par

value $0.10 per share (“Common Shares”), of the corporation, and of any other

junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the

Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly

dividends payable in cash on the first day of December, March, June and

September in each year (each such date being referred to in this Section 4.7

as a “Quarterly Dividend Payment Date”), commencing on the first Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a

share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the

nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1 or (b) subject to the provision

for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share

amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount

(payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than

a dividend payable in Common Shares or a subdivision of the outstanding Common

Shares (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Shares since

the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to

the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any

share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the

corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares

payable in Common Shares, or effect a subdivision or combination or

consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or

otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Shares) into a greater or

lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such case the amount to which

holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior

to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by

multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of

Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of

which is the number of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior

to such event.



  



(B) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of

Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next

preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such

shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the

date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination

of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a

quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either

of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from

such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not

bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an

amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and

payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis

among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix

a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred

Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared

thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date

fixed for the payment thereof.



  



Subsection 4.7.3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred

Stock shall have the following voting rights:



  



(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share

of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on

all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the corporation.



  



(B) Except as otherwise provided in these Articles of Incorporation, in any

other Resolution of the Board of Directors creating a series of Cumulative

Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of

Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Shares and any other

capital stock of the corporation having general voting rights shall vote

together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of

the corporation.



  



(C) Except as set forth in these Articles of Incorporation or as otherwise

provided by law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special

voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent

they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Shares as set forth herein)

for taking any corporate action.



* * *



Subsection 4.7.4. Certain Restrictions.



  



(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable

on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Subsection 4.7.2 are in

arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and

distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock

outstanding shall have been paid in full, the corporation shall not:



  



(i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares

of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;



  



(ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares

of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends

paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on

which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts

to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;



  



(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any

stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution

or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the corporation

may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such

junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the corporation ranking

junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up)

to the Series A Preferred Stock; or



  



(iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of

Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the

Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in

writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all

holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after

consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative

rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine

in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective

series or classes.



  



(B) The corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the corporation to

purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the

corporation unless the corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this

Subsection 4.7.4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and

in such manner.



  



Subsection 4.7.5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock

purchased or otherwise acquired by the corporation in any manner whatsoever

shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such

shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of

Cumulative Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of

Cumulative Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on

issuance set forth in these Articles of Incorporation or in any other

Resolution of the Board of Directors creating a series of Cumulative Preferred

Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.



  



Subsection 4.7.6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any

liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, no distribution

shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as

to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A

Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A

Preferred Stock shall have received $250 per share, plus an amount equal to

accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not

declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of

Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per

share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to

1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of

Common Shares, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity

(either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with

the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series

A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts

to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation,

dissolution or winding up. In the event the corporation shall at any time

declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or

effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common

Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in

Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in each

such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series A

Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the

proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by

multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of

Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of

which is the number of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior

to such event.



* * *



Subsection 4.7.7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the corporation shall

enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in

which the Common Shares are exchanged for or changed into other stock or

securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share

of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or

changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment

hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock,

securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may

be, into which or for which each Common Share is changed or exchanged. In the

event the corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the

Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect a subdivision or combination

or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or

otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Shares) into a greater or

lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in

the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of

Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a

fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding

immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



  



Subsection 4.7.8. No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall

not be redeemable.



  



Subsection 4.7.9. Rank. The Series A Preferred Stock shall be of equal rank,

with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, to

Subsection 4.7.10. Amendment. These Articles of Incorporation shall not be

amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers,

preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect

them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-

thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together

as a single class. In addition to the rights, preferences and privileges

accorded to the Series A Preferred Stock in this Section 4.7, the Series A

Preferred Stock shall have the rights, privileges and preferences, and be

subject to the limitations, accorded generally to the Cumulative Preferred

Stock in the foregoing Sections 4.1 through 4.6.

Subsection 10.2.2. For the purpose of determining whether a person is an

* * *



SECTION 10.3. Repurchase Procedure.



  



Not later than thirty (30) days following the date on which the corporation

receives credible notice that any person has become an Acquiring Person

whereupon the right shall be engendered to have Common Stock repurchased by

the corporation under this Article X, the corporation shall give written

notice, by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address shown on the

records of the corporation, to each holder of record of Common Stock (and to

any other person known by the corporation to have rights to demand repurchase

pursuant to Section 10.1 of this Article) as of a date not more than seven (7)

days prior to the date of the mailing pursuant to this Section 10.3 and shall

advise each such holder of the right to have shares repurchased and the

procedures for such repurchase. In the event that the corporation fails to

give notice as required by this Section 10.3, any holder entitled to receive

such notice may within thirty (30) days thereafter serve written demand upon

the corporation to give such notice. If within thirty (30) days after the

receipt of written demand the corporation fails to give the required notice,

such holder may at the expense and on behalf of the corporation take such

reasonable action as may be appropriate to give notice or to cause notice to

be given pursuant to this Section 10.3.



  



Subsection 10.3.1. In the event Common Stock is subject to repurchase in

accordance with this Article X, the directors of the corporation shall

designate a Repurchase Agent, which shall be a corporation or association (i)

organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any State,

(ii) subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority,

(iii) having combined capital and surplus of at least $5,000,000 and (iv)

having the power to exercise corporate trust powers.



  



Subsection 10.3.2. For a period of ninety days from the date of the mailing of

the notice to holders of Common Stock referred to in this Section 10.3,

holders of Common Stock and other persons entitled to have Common Stock

repurchased pursuant to this Article X may, at their option, deposit

certificates representing all or less than all Common Stock held of record by

them with the Repurchase Agent together with written notice that the holder

elects to have such shares repurchased pursuant to this Article X. Repurchase

shall be deemed to have been effected at the close of business on the day such

certificates are deposited in proper form with the Repurchase Agent.



  



Subsection 10.3.3. The corporation shall promptly deposit in trust with the

Repurchase Agent cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Repurchase Price of

all of the Common Stock deposited with the Repurchase Agent for purposes of

repurchase.



  



Subsection 10.3.4. As soon as practicable after receipt by the Repurchase

Agent of the cash deposit by the corporation referred to in this Section 10.3,

the Repurchase Agent shall issue its checks payable to the order of the

persons entitled to receive the Repurchase Price of the Common Stock in

respect of which such cash deposit was made.



  



Subsection 10.3.5. In the event the corporation is unable to deposit with the

Repurchase Agent cash in the full amount of the aggregate Repurchase Price of

all shares deposited for repurchase, because of limitations upon repurchase of

Common Stock contained in the Wisconsin Statutes, in Article IV hereof, or in

any loan agreement entered into at any time by the corporation, the

corporation shall promptly deposit with the Repurchase Agent the maximum

amount of cash which may be used for the repurchase of Common Stock, under the

most restrictive of the applicable limitations upon such repurchase. In the

event of deposit of less than the full aggregate Repurchase Price pursuant to

the provisions of this subsection, the Repurchase Agent shall use the amount

so deposited to repurchase the deposited shares pro tanto, in proportion to

the number of shares deposited by each shareholder for repurchase.

Certificates representing all shares which remain unpurchased shall be

arising in connection with the transactions already completed.



  



SECTION 10.4. Retired Stock.



  



All Common Stock with respect to which repurchase has been effected pursuant

to this Article X shall thereupon be deemed retired.

per share of Common Stock.

Subsection 10.5.1. The determinations to be made pursuant to Section 10.5

any attempted Transfer of Corporation Securities pursuant to an agreement

entered into prior to the Expiration Date, shall be prohibited and void ab

initio to the extent that, as a result of such Transfer (or any series of

Transfers of which such Transfer is a part), either (i) any Person or Persons

would become a 4.9-percent Stockholder or (ii) the Percentage Stock Ownership

in the Corporation of any 4.9-percent Stockholder would be increased.



(c) Exceptions.



(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Transfers to a Public

(2) The restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this Article ELEVENTH shall

not apply to an attempted Transfer that is a 4.9-percent Transaction if the

transferor or the Transferee obtains the written approval of the Board of

Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof. As a condition to granting

its approval pursuant to this paragraph (c) of this Article ELEVENTH, the

Board of Directors, may, in its discretion, require (at the expense of the

transferor and/or transferee) an opinion of counsel selected by the Board of

Directors that the Transfer shall not result in the application of any Section

382 of the Code limitation on the use of the Tax Benefits; provided that the

Board may grant such approval notwithstanding the effect of such approval on

the Tax Benefits if it determines that the approval is in the best interests

of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may impose any conditions that it

deems reasonable and appropriate in connection with such approval, including,

without limitation, restrictions on the ability of any Transferee to Transfer

Stock acquired through a Transfer. Approvals of the Board of Directors

hereunder may be given prospectively or retroactively. The Board of Directors,

to the fullest extent permitted by law, may exercise the authority granted by

this Article ELEVENTH through duly authorized officers or agents of the

Corporation. Nothing in this paragraph (c) of this Article ELEVENTH shall be

construed to limit or restrict the Board of Directors in the exercise of its

fiduciary duties under applicable law.



(d) Excess Securities.



(1) No employee or agent of the Corporation shall record any Prohibited

Transfer, and the purported transferee of such a Prohibited Transfer (the

Purported Transferee) shall not



3



  



be recognized as a stockholder of the Corporation for any purpose whatsoever

in respect of the Corporation Securities which are the subject of the

Prohibited Transfer (the Excess Securities). Until the Excess Securities are

acquired by another person in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer,

the Purported Transferee shall not be entitled with respect to such Excess

Securities to any rights of stockholders of the Corporation, including,

without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive

dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect

thereof, if any, and the Excess Securities shall be deemed to remain with the

transferor unless and until the Excess Securities are transferred to the Agent

pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Article ELEVENTH or until an approval is

obtained under paragraph (c) of this Article ELEVENTH. After the Excess

Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer,

the Corporation Securities shall cease to be Excess Securities. For this

purpose, any Transfer of Excess Securities not in accordance with the

provisions of paragraphs (d) or (e) of this Article ELEVENTH shall also be a

Prohibited Transfer.



(2) The Corporation may require as a condition to the registration of the

Transfer of any Corporation Securities or the payment of any distribution on

any Corporation Securities that the proposed Transferee or payee furnish to

the Corporation all information reasonably requested by the Corporation with

respect to its direct or indirect ownership interests in such Corporation

Securities. The Corporation may make such arrangements or issue such

instructions to its stock transfer agent as may be determined by the Board of

Directors to be necessary or advisable to implement this Article ELEVENTH,

including, without limitation, authorizing such transfer agent to require an

affidavit from a Purported Transferee regarding such Persons actual and

constructive ownership of stock and other evidence that a Transfer will not be

prohibited by this Article ELEVENTH as a condition to registering any

transfer.



(e) Transfer To Agent. If the Board of Directors determines that a Transfer of

Corporation Securities constitutes a Prohibited Transfer then, upon written

demand by the Corporation sent within thirty days of the date on which the

Board of Directors determines that the attempted Transfer would result in

Excess Securities, the Purported Transferee shall transfer or cause to be

transferred any certificate or other evidence of ownership of the Excess

Securities within the Purported Transferees possession or control, together

with any Prohibited Distributions, to an agent designated by the Board of

Directors (the Agent). The Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers,

which may include the Corporation, the Excess Securities transferred to it in

one or more arms-length transactions (on the public securities market on

which such Excess Securities are traded, if possible, or otherwise privately);

provided, however, that any such sale must not constitute a Prohibited

Transfer and provided, further, that the Agent shall effect such sale or sales

in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within

any specific time frame if, in the Agents discretion, such sale or sales

would disrupt the market for the Corporation Securities or otherwise would

adversely affect the value of the Corporation Securities. If the Purported

Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the Corporations

demand to surrender Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee

shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be

required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and proceeds of

such sale, except to the extent that the Corporation grants written permission

to the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of such sales proceeds not

exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from

the Agent pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Article ELEVENTH if the Agent

rather than the Purported Transferee had resold the Excess Securities.



4



  



(f) Application Of Proceeds And Prohibited Distributions. The Agent shall

apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities and, if the Purported

Transferee has previously resold the Excess Securities, any amounts received

by it from a Purported Transferee, together, in either case, with any

Prohibited Distributions, as follows: (a) first, such amounts shall be paid to

the Agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred in

connection with its duties hereunder; (b) second, any remaining amounts shall

be paid to the Purported Transferee, up to the amount paid by the Purported

Transferee for the Excess Securities (or the fair market value at the time of

the Transfer, in the event the purported Transfer of the Excess Securities

was, in whole or in part, a gift, inheritance or similar Transfer) which

amount shall be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors; and

(c) third, any remaining amounts shall be paid to one or more organizations

qualifying under section 501(c)(3) of the Code (or any comparable successor

provision) selected by the Board of Directors. The Purported Transferee of

Excess Securities shall have no claim, cause of action or any other recourse

whatsoever against any transferor of Excess Securities. The Purported

Transferees sole right with respect to such shares shall be limited to the

amount payable to the Purported Transferee pursuant to this paragraph (f) of

Article ELEVENTH. In no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess

Securities pursuant to this paragraph (f) of Article ELEVENTH inure to the

benefit of the Corporation or the Agent, except to the extent used to cover

costs and expenses incurred by Agent in performing its duties hereunder.



(g) Modification Of Remedies For Certain Indirect Transfers. In the event of

any Transfer which does not involve a transfer of a Corporation Security, but

which would cause a 4.9-percent Stockholder to violate a restriction on

Transfers provided for in this Article ELEVENTH, the application of paragraphs

(e) and (f) of this Article ELEVENTH shall be modified as described in this

paragraph (g) of this Article ELEVENTH. In such case, no such 4.9-percent

Stockholder shall be required to dispose of any interest that is not a

Corporation Security, but such 4.9-percent Stockholder and/or any Person whose

ownership of Corporation Securities is attributed to such 4.9-percent

Stockholder shall be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to

dispose of sufficient Corporation Securities (which Corporation Securities

shall be disposed of first by such 4.9-percent Stockholder and then by any

other Person in the inverse order in which they were acquired) to cause such

4.9-percent Stockholder, following such disposition, not to be in violation of

this Article ELEVENTH. Such disposition shall be deemed to occur

simultaneously with the Transfer giving rise to the application of this

provision, and such number of Corporation Securities that are deemed to be

disposed of shall be considered Excess Securities and shall be disposed of

through the Agent as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Article

ELEVENTH, except that the maximum aggregate amount payable either to such

4.9-percent Stockholder, or to such other Person that was the direct holder of

such Excess Securities, in connection with such sale shall be the fair market

value of such Excess Securities at the time of the purported Transfer. All

expenses incurred by the Agent in disposing of such Excess Stock shall be paid

out of any amounts due such 4.9-percent Stockholder or such other Person. The

purpose of this paragraph (g) of Article ELEVENTH is to extend the

restrictions in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this Article ELEVENTH to situations

in which there is a 4.9-percent Transaction without a direct Transfer of

Corporation Securities, and this paragraph (g) of Article ELEVENTH, along with

the other provisions of this Article ELEVENTH, shall be interpreted to produce

the same results, with differences as the context requires, as a direct

Transfer of Corporation Securities.



5



  



(h) Legal Proceedings; Prompt Enforcement. If the Purported Transferee fails

to surrender the Excess Securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof to the

Agent within thirty days from the date on which the Corporation makes a

written demand pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Article ELEVENTH (whether or

not made within the time specified in paragraph (e) of this Article ELEVENTH),

then the Corporation shall promptly take all cost effective actions which it

believes are appropriate to enforce the provisions hereof, including the

institution of legal proceedings to compel the surrender. Nothing in this

paragraph (h) of Article ELEVENTH shall (i) be deemed inconsistent with any

Transfer of the Excess Securities provided in this Article ELEVENTH being void

ab initio, (ii) preclude the Corporation in its discretion from immediately

bringing legal proceedings without a prior demand, or (iii) cause any failure

of the Corporation to act within the time periods set forth in paragraph (e)

of this Article ELEVENTH to constitute a waiver or loss of any right of the

Corporation under this Article ELEVENTH. The Board of Directors may authorize

such additional actions as it deems advisable to give effect to the provisions

of this Article ELEVENTH.



(i) Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any stockholder subject

to the provisions of this Article ELEVENTH who knowingly violates the

provisions of this Article ELEVENTH and any Persons controlling, controlled by

or under common control with such stockholder shall be jointly and severally

liable to the Corporation for, and shall indemnify and hold the Corporation

harmless against, any and all damages suffered as a result of such violation,

including, but not limited, to damages resulting from a reduction in, or

elimination of, the Corporations ability to utilize its Tax Benefits, and

attorneys and auditors fees incurred in connection with such violation.



(j) Obligation To Provide Information. As a condition to the registration of

the Transfer of any Stock, any Person who is a beneficial, legal or record

holder of Stock, and any proposed Transferee and any Person controlling,

controlled by or under common control with the proposed Transferee, shall

provide such information as the Corporation may request from time-to-time in

order to determine compliance with this Article ELEVENTH or the status of the

Tax Benefits of the Corporation.



(k) Legends. The Board of Directors may require that any certificates issued

by the Corporation evidencing ownership of shares of Stock that are subject to

the restrictions on transfer and ownership contained in this Article ELEVENTH

bear the following legend:



THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED (THE CHARTER), OF THE CORPORATION

CONTAINS RESTRICTIONS PROHIBITING THE TRANSFER (AS DEFINED IN THE CHARTER) OF

COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATION (INCLUDING THE CREATION OR GRANT OF CERTAIN

OPTIONS, RIGHTS AND WARRANTS) WITHOUT THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS OF THE CORPORATION (THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS) IF SUCH TRANSFER

RESULTS IN THE PERCENTAGE OF STOCK OF THE CORPORATION (WITHIN THE MEANING OF

SECTION 382 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE CODE) AND

THE TREASURY REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER), OWNED BY A PERSON (AS

DEFINED IN THE CHARTER) BEING AT THE LEVEL OF 4.9 PERCENT OR MORE. IF THE

TRANSFER



6



  



RESTRICTIONS ARE VIOLATED, THEN THE TRANSFER WILL BE VOID AB INITIO AND THE

PURPORTED TRANSFEREE OF THE STOCK WILL BE REQUIRED TO TRANSFER EXCESS

SECURITIES (AS DEFINED IN THE CHARTER) TO THE CORPORATIONS AGENT. IN THE

EVENT OF A TRANSFER WHICH DOES NOT INVOLVE A TRANSFER OF A CORPORATION

SECURITY (AS DEFINED IN THE CHARTER) BUT WHICH WOULD VIOLATE THE TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS, THE PURPORTED TRANSFEREE (OR THE RECORD OWNER) OF THE

CORPORATION SECURITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO TRANSFER SUFFICIENT CORPORATION

SECURITIES PURSUANT TO THE TERMS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CORPORATIONS CHARTER TO

CAUSE THE 4.9-PERCENT STOCKHOLDER TO NO LONGER BE IN VIOLATION OF THE TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS. THE CORPORATION WILL FURNISH WITHOUT CHARGE TO THE HOLDER OF

RECORD OF THIS CERTIFICATE, A COPY OF THE CHARTER CONTAINING THE ABOVE-

REFERENCED TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE CORPORATION AT

ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS.



The Board of Directors may also require that any certificates issued by the

Corporation evidencing ownership of shares of Stock that are subject to

conditions imposed by the Board of Directors under paragraph (c) of this

Article ELEVENTH also bear a conspicuous legend referencing the applicable

restrictions.



(l) Authority Of Board Of Directors.



(1) The Board of Directors shall have the power to determine all matters

necessary for assessing compliance with this Article ELEVENTH, including,

without limitation, (i) the identification of 4.9-percent Stockholders, (ii)

whether a Transfer is a 4.9-percent Transaction or a Prohibited Transfer,

(iii) the Percentage Stock Ownership in the Corporation of any 4.9-percent

Stockholder, (iv) whether an instrument constitutes a Corporation Security,

(v) the amount (or fair market value) due to a Purported Transferee pursuant

to paragraph (f) of this Article ELEVENTH, and (vi) any other matters which

the Board of Directors determines to be relevant; and the good faith

determination of the Board of Directors on such matters shall be conclusive

and binding for all the purposes of this Article ELEVENTH. In addition, the

Board of Directors may, to the extent permitted by law, from time-to-time

establish, modify, amend or rescind the Bylaws, regulations and procedures of

the Corporation not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article ELEVENTH

for purposes of determining whether any Transfer of Corporation Securities

would jeopardize the Corporations ability to preserve and use the Tax

Benefits and for the orderly application, administration and implementation of

this Article ELEVENTH.



(2) Nothing contained in this Article ELEVENTH shall limit the authority of

the Board of Directors to take such other action to the extent permitted by

law as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and its

stockholders in preserving the Tax Benefits. Without limiting the generality

of the foregoing, in the event of a change in law or other relevant

circumstances making one or more of the following actions necessary or

desirable in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, the Board of

Directors may, by adopting a written resolution, (i) accelerate or extend the

Expiration Date (including acceleration or extension to a specified date),

(ii) modify the ownership interest percentage in the Corporation or the

Persons or



7



  



groups covered by this Article ELEVENTH, (iii) modify the definitions of any

terms set forth in this Article ELEVENTH, or (iv) modify the terms of this

Article ELEVENTH as appropriate; provided, however, that the Board of

Directors shall not cause there to be such acceleration, extension or

modification unless it determines, by adopting a written resolution, that such

action is reasonably necessary or advisable to preserve the Tax Benefits or

that the continuation of these restrictions is no longer reasonably necessary

or advisable for the preservation of the Tax Benefits. Stockholders of the

Corporation shall be notified of such determination through a filing with the

Securities and Exchange Commission or such other method of notice as the

Secretary of the Corporation shall deem appropriate.



(3) In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of

this Article ELEVENTH, including any definition used herein, the Board of

Directors shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions

with respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or

knowledge of the circumstances. In the event this Article ELEVENTH requires an

action by the Board of Directors but fails to provide specific guidance with

respect to such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to

determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the

provisions of this Article ELEVENTH. All such actions, calculations,

interpretations and determinations which are done or made by the Board of

Directors in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the Corporation,

the Agent, and all other parties for all other purposes of this Article

ELEVENTH. The Board of Directors may delegate all or any portion of its duties

and powers under this Article ELEVENTH to a committee of the Board of

Directors as it deems necessary or advisable and, to the fullest extent

permitted by law, may exercise the authority granted by this Article ELEVENTH

through duly authorized officers or agents of the Corporation. Nothing in this

Article ELEVENTH shall be construed to limit or restrict the Board of

Directors in the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.



(m) Reliance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation and the

members of the Board of Directors shall be fully protected in relying in good

faith upon the information, opinions, reports or statements of the chief

executive officer, the chief financial officer, chief legal officer, the chief

accounting officer or the corporate controller of the Corporation and the

Corporations legal counsel, independent auditors, transfer agent, investment

bankers or other employees and agents in making the determinations and

findings contemplated by this Article ELEVENTH. The members of the Board of

Directors shall not be responsible for any good faith errors made in

connection therewith. For purposes of determining the existence and identity

of, and the amount of any Corporation Securities owned by any stockholder, the

Corporation is entitled to rely on the existence and absence of filings of

Schedule 13D or 13G under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended

(or similar filings), as of any date, subject to its actual knowledge of the

ownership of Corporation Securities.



(n) Benefits Of This Article ELEVENTH. Nothing in this Article ELEVENTH shall

be construed to give to any Person other than the Corporation or the Agent any

legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Article ELEVENTH. This

Article ELEVENTH shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the

Corporation and the Agent.



(o) Severability. The purpose of this Article ELEVENTH is to facilitate the

Corporations ability to maintain or preserve its Tax Benefits. If any

provision of this Article ELEVENTH or



8



  



the application of any such provision to any Person or under any circumstance

shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of

competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall

not affect any other provision of this Article ELEVENTH.



(p) Waiver. With regard to any power, remedy or right provided herein or

otherwise available to the Corporation or the Agent under this Article

ELEVENTH, (i) no waiver will be effective unless expressly contained in a

writing signed by the waiving party; and (ii) no alteration, modification or

impairment will be implied by reason of any previous waiver, extension of

time, delay or omission in exercise, or other indulgence.



SECOND: The foregoing amendment does not increase the authorized stock of the

Corporation.



THIRD: The foregoing amendment to the Charter of the Corporation has been

advised by the Board of Directors and approved by the stockholders of the

Corporation.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The Ryland Group, Inc., has caused these presents to be

the consideration to be received in the business combination by the holders of

the Corporation's Common Shares and Preferred Shares, and by the Corporation

or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, meets the following tests:



(a) Amount of Consideration to Be Received by Shareholders. If any holder of

shareholder, is to receive consideration in the business combination for any

of the shares, the aggregate amount of cash and fair market value of any other

consideration to be received per share may not be less than the sum of ‑ -

paid by the interested shareholder for any shares of the same class or series

the interested shareholder of any such shares, (ii) the highest sales price

reported for shares of the same class or series traded on a national

securities exchange or in the over‑the‑counter market during the one year

period preceding the first public announcement of the pro‑posed business

transaction, or (iii) in thecase of Preferred Shares, the amount of the per

share liquidation preference; plus



(B) interest on the per share price calculated at the prime rate for unsecured

on which the interested shareholder first became an interested shareholder,

compounded annually from that date until the business combination is

consummated, less the per share amount of cash dividends payable to holders of

record on record dates in the interim, up to the amount of such interest.



For purposes of this clause (a), per share amounts will be adjusted for any

stock dividend, stock split, or similar transaction.



(b) Form of Consideration to Be Received by Shareholders. The consideration to

be received by holders of the Corporation's Common Shares or Preferred Shares

must be in cash or in the same form as was previously paid by the interested

shareholder for shares of the same class or series; if the interested

shareholder previously paid for such shares with different forms of

consideration, the consideration to be received by the holders of the shares

must be in cash or in the same form as was previously paid by the interested

shareholder for the largest number of shares previously acquired by it. The

provisions of this clause (b) are not intended to diminish the aggregate

amount of cash and fair market value of any other consideration that any

holder of the Corporation's Common Shares or



* * *



Preferred Shares is otherwise entitled to receive upon the liquidation or

dissolution of the Corporation, under the terms of any contract with the

Corporation or an interested shareholder, or otherwise.



(c) Consideration to Be Received by the Corporation or Any of Its

Subsidiaries. If the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries is to receive

consideration in the business combination, the consideration to be received

must be fair to the Corporation or its subsidiaries, as determined by the

continuing directors (as hereinafter defined).



3\. Other Conditions. The other conditions will be satisfied if, from the time

the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder until the

completion of the business combination, each of the following has at all times

been and continues to be true:



(a) Continuing Directors. The Corporation's Board of Directors has included at

least five continuing directors. The term ""continuing director"", as used in

this Article, means an individual who (i) either was a director of the

Corporation at the time the interested shareholder became an interested

shareholder or was subsequently nominated or elected by the other continuing

directors and (ii) is not an affiliate or associate (as hereinafter defined)

of the interested shareholder. All actions required or permitted to be taken

by the continuing directors under this Article shall be taken by the unanimous

written consent of all continuing directors or by the vote of a majority of

the continuing directors at a meeting convened upon such notice as would be

required for a meeting of the full Board of Directors.



(b) No Acquisition of Additional Shares. The interested shareholder has not

become the beneficial owner (as hereinafter defined) of any additional Common

Shares or Preferred Shares of the Corporation, except (i) as part of the

transaction that resulted in the interested shareholder becoming an interested

shareholder, (ii) upon conversion of securities previously acquired by it, or

(iii) pursuant to a stock dividend or stock split.



(c) No Special Benefits to the Interested Shareholder. The interested

shareholder has not received, directly or indirectly, the benefit (except

proportionately as a shareholder) of any loan, advance, guaranty, pledge, or

Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.



(d) Proxy Statement. A proxy or information statement describing the business

combination and complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act

of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations under it (or any subsequent

provisions replacing that Act and the rules and regulations under it) has been

mailed at least 30 days prior to the completion of the business combination to

the holders of all outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote in

elections of directors, whether or not shareholder approval of the business

combination is required. If deemed advisable by the continuing directors, the

proxy or information statement shall contain a recommendation by the

continuing directors as to the advisability (or inadvisability) of the

business combination and/or an opinion by an investment banking firm, selected

by the continuing directors and retained at the expense of the Corporation, as

to the fairness (or unfairness) of the business combination to holders of the

Corporation's Common Shares or Preferred Shares other than the interested

shareholder.



(e) No Omission or Reduction of Dividends. Except to the extent approved by

the continuing directors, there has been no (i) failure to pay in full, when

and as due, any dividends on the Corporation's Preferred Shares or (ii)

failure to pay or reduction in the annual rate of dividends on the

Corporation's Common Shares, whether directly or indirectly through a

reclassification, recapitalization, or otherwise.



(f) No Change in Business or Capital Structure. Except to the extent approved

by the continuing directors, there has been no material change in (i) the

nature of the business conducted by the Corporation and its subsidiaries

or(ii) the capital structure of the Corporation, including but not limited to

any change in the number of outstanding Common Shares, the number and series

STATEMENT OF RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING THE



CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES C



OF



RYDER SYSTEM, INC.



Pursuant to the provisions of Section 607.0602 of the Florida Business

Corporation Act, the undersigned corporation submits the following statement

for the purpose of establishing and designating a series within the class of

its preferred stock, without par value (the “Preferred Stock”), and fixing and

determining the relative rights and preferences thereof:



1\. The name of the corporation is Ryder System, Inc. (the “Corporation”).



2\. The following resolutions, establishing and designating a series of

Preferred Stock, and fixing and determining the relative rights and

preferences thereof, were duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the

Corporation on March 8, 1996:



RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority expressly granted to the Board of

Directors by the provisions of Article III of the Restated Articles of

Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation, the Board of Directors hereby

establishes a series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, without par value,

designated as Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (hereinafter referred to as

the “Series C Preferred Stock”), consisting of 900,000 shares of Series C

Preferred Stock, which the Corporation has authority to issue.



FURTHER RESOLVED, that the designations, preferences and relative, optional or

other special rights of the Series C Preferred Stock and the qualifications,

limitations and restrictions thereof are as follows:



1\. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be designated as

the “Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C” (the “Series C Preferred Stock”)

and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 900,000 (which

number may be increased or decreased by the Board of Directors without a vote

of shareholders).



2\. Dividends and Distributions.



(a) The holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, in preference to the

holders of Common Stock, par value $.50 per share, of the Corporation (the

“Common Stock”) and of any other stock ranking junior to the Series C

Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends shall be entitled to receive, when,

as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available

therefor, quarterly dividends payable in cash in March, June, September and

December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a “Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date”), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series C

Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to

the greater of (i) $10 or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment

hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash

dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of

all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable

in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common

Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since

the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to

the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any

share or fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock. In the event the

Corporation shall at any time after March 18, 1996 pay any dividend on Common

Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or effect a subdivision or combination

or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a divided in shares of Common

Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each

such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock

were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the

preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction

the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



  



  



* * *



Exhibit 3.1



  



(b) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series C

Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2 immediately

after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a

dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no

dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during

the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $10 per share on the Series C

Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date.



(c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of

Series C Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next

preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock, unless

the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall

begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of

issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date

for the determination of holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock

entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend

Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue

and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but

unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of

Series C Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such

dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shall be allocated pro rata

on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The

Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of

shares of Series C Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend

or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60

days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.



3\. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall

have the following voting rights:



(a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the holder

of a whole or fractional share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled

to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the

Corporation, on the basis of 100 votes for each share. In the event the

Corporation shall at any time after March 18, 1996 pay any dividend on Common

Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or

combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of

Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then

in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of

Series C Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall

be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is

the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event

and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



(b) So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, and

unless the vote or consent of a greater number of shares of such series shall

then be required by law, the consent of the holders of a majority of the

shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately

as a class, shall be necessary to approve a voluntary dissolution of the

Corporation.



(c) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Restated Articles of

Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended, or by law, the holders of shares

of Series C Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall

vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders

of the Corporation.



(d) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Restated Articles of

Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended, or by law, holders of Series C

Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall

not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders

of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.



4\. Certain Restrictions.



(a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable

on the Series C Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears,

thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions,

whether or not declared, on shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding

shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:



(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or

purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking

junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)

to the Series C Preferred Stock;



  



  



* * *



Exhibit 3.1



  



(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distribution on any shares

of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

dissolution or winding up) with the Series C Preferred Stock, except dividends

paid ratably on the Series C Preferred Stock and all stock ranking on a parity

with the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends and on which dividends are

payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders

of all such shares are then entitled;



(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any

stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution

or winding up) to the Series C Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation

may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such

junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking

junior (as to dividends and upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to

the Series C Preferred Stock; or



(iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series C

Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to

dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series C

Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or

by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of

such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of

the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences

of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will

result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.



(b) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to

purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the

Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (a) of this Section

4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.



5\. Redemption.



(a) The shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, at the option

of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in whole but not in part, out of

funds legally available therefor, upon mailing Notice of Redemption pursuant

to paragraph (b) of this Section 5 during the following periods:



(i) any time as there shall be outstanding less that 90,000 shares of Series C

Preferred Stock; provided, in the event the Corporation shall at any time

after March 18, 1996 pay any dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock payable

in shares of Series C Preferred Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination

or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (by

reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of

Series C Preferred Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Series

C Preferred Stock, then in each such case such number shall be adjusted by

multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of

shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding immediately after such event

and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Series C Preferred

Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event; and provided

further, however, that such right of redemption shall not be available during

the 90-day period following the first issuance of any share or fraction of a

share of Series C Preferred Stock. For purposes of this clause (i), shares of

Series C Preferred Stock (A) owned by the Corporation or any of its direct or

indirect subsidiaries, or (B) as to which Notice of Redemption pursuant to

paragraph (b) of this Section 5 has been duly mailed and a sum sufficient to

redeem such shares shall have been deposited with the transfer agent for the

Series C Preferred Stock with irrevocable instructions to pay the redemption

price to the holders thereof, shall not be considered to be outstanding;



(ii) during the 90-day period after the date on which the Board of Directors

shall have adopted a resolution recommending that the Corporation be dissolved

and directing that the question of such dissolution be submitted to a vote of

shareholders, at a meeting or otherwise; provided, however, that, unless

Notice of Redemption previously has been mailed pursuant to paragraph (b) of

this Section 5, such right of redemption shall not be available after the date

such dissolution proceedings are abandoned, or the date on which the

shareholders of the Corporation entitled to vote on such matter, so voted

(until a subsequent resolution of such kind shall have been adopted);



(iii) during the 90-day period after the date on which the Board of Directors

of the Corporation shall have approved a plan of merger or consolidation of

the Corporation with or into any other corporation or the sale of all or

substantially all of the assets of the Corporation in exchange for stock or

securities of another corporation and directed that the plan or the resolution

providing for such sale be submitted to a vote



  



  



* * *



Exhibit 3.1



  



of shareholders at a meeting or otherwise; provided, however, that, unless

Notice of Redemption previously has been mailed pursuant to paragraph (b) of

this Section 5, such right of redemption shall not be available after the date

such merger, consolidation or sale of assets is abandoned, or voting by the

shareholders entitled to vote on such matter is completed (until a subsequent

resolution of such kind shall have been approved or solicitation of such kind

made).



(b) Whenever shares of Series C Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the

Corporation shall mail a notice (“Notice of Redemption”) by first-class mail,

postage prepaid, to each holder of record of shares of Series C Preferred

Stock to be redeemed and to the transfer agent for the Series C Preferred

Stock. The Notice of Redemption shall be addressed to the holder at the

address of the holder appearing on the stock transfer books of the Corporation

maintained by the transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Stock. The Notice

of Redemption shall include a statement of (i) the redemption date (which

shall be not less than 30 days after the mailing of such Notice of

Redemption), (ii) the redemption price (to the extent then determinable or, if

not then determinable, the manner in which the redemption price will be

calculated), (iii) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be

redeemed, (iv) the place or places where shares of the Series C Preferred

Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, (v) that the

dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption

date, and (vi) the provision under which redemption is made. No defect in the

Notice of Redemption or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of

the redemption proceedings, except as required by law. On and after the date

on which a Notice of Redemption shall have been mailed as aforesaid and the

Corporation shall have deposited with the transfer agent for the Series C

Preferred Stock a sum sufficient to redeem the shares of Series C Preferred

Stock as to which Notice of Redemption has been given, with irrevocable

instructions and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders thereof,

or if no such deposit is made, then upon such date fixed for redemption

(unless the Corporation shall default in making payment of the redemption

price), all rights of the holders thereof as stockholders of the Corporation

by reason of the ownership of such shares (except their right to receive the

redemption price thereof, but without interest), shall terminate, and such

shares shall no longer be deemed outstanding. The Corporation shall be

entitled to receive, from time to time, from the transfer agent for the Series

C Preferred Stock the interest, if any, on such monies deposited with it and

the holders of any shares so redeemed shall have no claim to any such

interest. In case the holder of any shares so called for redemption shall not

have properly surrendered the certificate or certificates for his shares in

exchange for the redemption price for such shares within one year after the

date of redemption, the transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Stock shall,

upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such amount remaining on deposit and

the transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Stock shall thereupon be

relieved of all responsibility to the holder of such shares and such holder of

the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall look

thereafter only to the Corporation for the payment thereof.



(c) Each share of the Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed pursuant to

paragraph (a) of this Section 5 shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal

to, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times

the “current per share market price” of the Common Stock on the date of the

mailing of the Notice of Redemption or, if later (in the case of a redemption

made pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (a) of this Section 5), on

the tenth business day following the date of the adoption or approval of the

Board of Directors referred to in said clause (ii) or (iii), and there shall

also be paid with respect to each such share which is redeemed an amount equal

to accrued and unpaid dividends on such share (whether or not earned or

declared) to the redemption date. In the event the Corporation shall at any

time after March 18, 1996 pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares

of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of

the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than

by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser

number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which

holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior

to such event under the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying

such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of

Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of

which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding

immediately prior to such event.



The “current per share market price” on any date shall be deemed to be the

average of the closing price per share of such Common Stock for the five

consecutive Trading Days (or such lesser number of Trading Days within such

period, being at least one, for which there shall be a closing price as

defined herein) preceding the second Trading Day prior to that date. The

closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in

case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and

asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal

consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or

admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Common Stock is

not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported

in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to

securities listed or admitted to trading on the principal national securities

exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if



  



  



* * *



Exhibit 3.1



  



the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any national

securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted the average of

the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported

by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations

System or such other system then in use or, if on any such date the Common

Stock is not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid

and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market

in the Common Stock selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The

term “Trading Day” shall mean a day on which the principal national securities

exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading is open

for the transaction of business or, if the Common Stock is not listed or

admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Monday, Tuesday,

Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on which banking institutions in the State of

New York are not authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.



(d) Except as set forth under Section 4 of this Statement and except as set

forth above with respect to redemptions, nothing contained in this Statement

shall limit any legal right of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise

acquire any shares of Series C Preferred Stock in privately negotiated

transactions or in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.



6\. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series C Preferred Stock purchased or

otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be

retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares

shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of

Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of any series of Preferred Stock

(including without limitation the Series C Preferred Stock), subject to the

conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth in the Restated Articles of

Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended.



7\. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation, dissolution

or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (a) to the

holders of shares of stock ranking junior upon liquidation, dissolution or

winding up to the Series C Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders

of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus

an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon,

whether or not earned or declared, to the date of such payment, or (b) to the

holders of stock ranking on a parity upon liquidation, dissolution or winding

up with the Series C Preferred Stock, except a distribution made ratably on

the Series C Preferred Stock and all other such parity stock in proportion to

the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon

such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.



8\. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any

consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of

Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash

and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series C

Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an

amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set

forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash

and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or

for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the

Corporation shall at any time after March 18, 1996 pay any dividend on Common

Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or

combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of

Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding

sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series C

Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the

numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



9\. Rank. The Series C Preferred Stock shall rank on a parity with all other

series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock outstanding as of March 18, 1996,

as to the payment of dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up

of the Corporation.



10\. Amendment. The Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the

Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or

change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series C Preferred

Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the

holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock,

voting together as a single class.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this statement to be executed

in its name by the undersigned, there unto duly authorized, this 5th day of

April, 1996.

1

PAGE 2

Stock, and to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by the

laws of the State of Delaware, in respect of the matters set forth

in the following subdivisions (a) and (g) inclusive:



(a) The distinctive designation of such series and the number of

shares which shall constitute such series, which number may be

increased (except where otherwise provided by the Board of

Directors in creating such series) or decreased (but not below the

number of shares thereof then outstanding) from time to time by

like action of the Board of Directors;



(b) The rate or rates at which shares of such series shall be

entitled to receive dividends, the conditions and limitations upon

the payment, and the preferences, of such dividends, whether such

dividends shall be cumulative and, if cumulative, the date or

dates from which such dividends shall accumulate, and the dates

upon which such dividends, if declared, shall be payable;



(c) The rights of the Corporation at its option to redeem shares

of such series, the manner of selecting shares for redemption, the

redemption price or prices, and the manner of redemption and the

effect thereof;



(d) The amount payable on shares of such series in the event of

any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the

Corporation which amount may vary depending upon whether such

liquidation, dissolution or winding up is voluntary or

involuntary;



(e) The obligation, if any, of the Corporation to maintain a

purchase, retirement or sinking fund for shares of such series, or

to redeem shares or such series and the provisions with respect

thereto;



(f) The rights, if any, of the holders of shares of such series to

convert such shares into shares of stock of the Corporation of any

class or of any series of any class and the terms and conditions

of such conversion; and



(g) The voting rights, if any, and any other preferences, and

relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and

qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof.



(3) The voting powers, preferences and rights, and the

qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable

to the Common Stock and to the Preferred Stock of all series,

except as set forth in Article Fifth hereof, are as follows:



(a) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock of each series shall

be entitled to such cash dividends, but only when and as declared

by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor,

as they may be entitled to in accordance with the resolution or

resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the

issuance of such series; and



(b) So long as there shall be outstanding any shares of Preferred

Stock of any series entitled to cumulative dividends pursuant to

the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such

series, no dividend, whether in cash or property, shall be paid or

declared, nor shall any distribution be made, on Common Stock, nor

shall any shares of Common Stock be purchased, redeemed, or

otherwise acquired for value by the Corporation, unless the full

cumulative

2

PAGE 3

dividends on the Preferred Stock of all series entitled to

cumulative dividends for all past quarterly dividend periods and

for the then current quarterly dividend period shall have been

paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set

apart. The foregoing provisions of this subdivision (b) shall not,

however, apply to a dividend payable in Common Stock or to the

acquisition of shares of Common Stock in exchange for, or through

application of the proceeds of the sale of, shares of Common

Stock.



Subject to the foregoing and to any further limitations prescribed

in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Article

Fourth, the Board of Directors may declare, out of any funds

legally available therefor, dividends upon the then outstanding

shares of Common Stock, and shares of Preferred Stock of any

series shall not be entitled to share therein.



(c) In the event of any liquidation or dissolution or winding up

of the Corporation, the holders of the Preferred Stock of each

series shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the

Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, before

any distribution of assets shall be made to the holders of Common

Stock, payment of the amount per share provided for in the

resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors

providing for the issuance of such series; and the holders of the

Common Stock shall be entitled, to the exclusion of the holders of

the Preferred Stock of any and all series, to share ratably in all

the assets of the Corporation then remaining in accordance with

their respective rights and preferences. If upon any liquidation

or dissolution or winding up of the Corporation the assets

available for distribution shall be insufficient to pay the

holders of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock the full

amounts to which they respectively shall be entitled, the holders

of shares of Preferred Stock of all series shall share ratably in

any distribution of assets according to the respective amounts

which would be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon

such distribution if all amounts payable in respect of the

Preferred Stock of all series were paid in full.  Neither the

statutory merger nor consolidation of the Corporation into or with

any other corporation, nor the statutory merger or consolidation

of any other corporation into or with the Corporation, nor a sale,

transfer or lease of all or any part of the assets of the

Corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or

winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this

subdivision (c).



(d) Except as provided in the resolution or resolutions providing

for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock, the exclusive

voting power for all purposes shall be vested in the holders of

Common Stock, each holder of Common Stock being entitled to one

vote for each share of Common Stock held by him.



(4) Shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock may be issued by

the Corporation from time to time for such consideration as may be

fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors. Shares for

which the consideration so fixed shall have been paid or delivered

shall be deemed fully paid stock and shall not be liable to any

further call or assessment thereon; and the holder of such shares

shall not be liable for any further payments in respect of such

shares.



(5) The amount of capital stock with which the Corporation will

commence business is One Thousand Dollars ($1,000). The

Corporation will also commence business with an original or paid

in surplus of not less than One Million Five Hundred Thousand

Dollars ($1,500,000).

PAGE 4

Fifth: No holder of Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be

entitled as such, as a matter of right, to subscribe for or

purchase any part of any new or additional issues of shares of any

class whatsoever or of any securities convertible into or

exchangeable for any shares of any class whatsoever, whether now

or hereafter authorized and whether issued for cash or other

consideration.

provided. It shall not be necessary to be a stockholder in order

to be a director.



Tenth: In furtherance, and not in limitation, of the powers

conferred by statute, the Board of Directors of the Corporation

are expressly authorized:



To make, alter, amend and rescind the Bylaws of the Corporation,

but any Bylaws, so made, altered or amended by the Board of

Directors may be altered, amended and rescinded either by the

directors or the stockholders of the Corporation.



To fix and change, from time to time, the amount that shall be

reserved as working capital.



To determine, from time to time, whether and to what extent, and

at what time and places, and under what conditions and

regulations, the accounts and books of the Corporation (other than

the stock ledger) or any of them shall be open to inspection of

the stockholders; and no stockholder shall have any right to

inspect any account, book or document of the Corporation, except

as conferred by statute, unless authorized by a resolution of the

stockholders or the Board of Directors of the Corporation.



To remove at any time any officer elected or appointed by the

Board of Directors, but only by the affirmative vote of a majority

of the then Board of Directors, and to remove any other officer or

employee of the Corporation or to confer such power on any

committee or officer. Any removal may be for cause or without

To designate from their number by vote of a majority of the entire

Board of Directors in accordance with law, an Executive Committee

of not less than three members, who, to the extent provided in the

Bylaws or the resolution of the Board of Directors so designating

them, shall have and exercise the powers of the Board of Directors

in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation

during the intervals between the meetings of the Board of

Directors and shall have power to authorize the seal of the

Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. The

Board may also appoint from their number such other committees as

they may deem judicious and to such extent as shall be provided by

resolution of the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws may delegate

to such committees all or any of the powers of the Board of

Directors which may be lawfully delegated. The Board of Directors

may fill vacancies in any committee appointed by it.



The stockholders having voting power of the Corporation may in its

Bylaws confer powers additional to the foregoing (not, however,

inconsistent with law) upon the Board of Directors, in addition to

the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon them by the

statutes of the State of Delaware.



Eleventh: The stockholders may hold their meetings, annual or

special, within or without the State of Delaware, if the Bylaws so

provide; and the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may

hold any or all of their meetings within or without the State of

Delaware at such places as the Board of Directors or the

Committee, as the case may be, may designate.



The Corporation may have one or more offices in addition to the

principal office in the State of Delaware and may keep its books

(except when otherwise expressly provided by law) outside the

State of Delaware at such places as may be, from time to time,

designated by the Board of Directors.



Twelfth: No contract or other transaction of the Corporation shall

be affected by the fact that any of the directors of the

Corporation are in any wise interested in or connected with any

other party to such contract or transaction or are themselves

parties to such contract or transaction, provided that at the

meeting of the Board of Directors authorizing or confirming such

contract or transaction there shall be present a quorum of

directors not so interested or connected and such contract or

transaction shall be approved by a majority of such quorum, which

majority shall consist of directors not so interested or

connected. Any contract, transaction or act of the Corporation or

of the Board of Directors or of the Executive Committee which

shall be ratified by a majority in interest of a quorum of the

stockholders of the Corporation having voting power at any annual

meeting or any special meeting called for such purpose shall be as

valid and as binding as though ratified by every stockholder of

the Corporation.



Thirteenth: The Corporation reserves the right (1) to create one

or more classes of stock with such designations, preferences,

redemption or dividend provisions and voting powers, or

restrictions or qualifications thereof, as shall be stated and

expressed in any certificate amendatory hereof, duly authorized,

executed and filed in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by

statutes of the State of Delaware, and (2) to amend, alter, change

or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of

Incorporation, or any amendment thereof, in the manner now or

hereafter prescribed by the statutes of the State of Delaware, and

all rights of the stockholders of the Corporation, except as

aforesaid, are granted subject to these reservations.

PAGE 6

Fourteenth: A director of the Corporation shall have no personal

liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary

damages for breach of his fiduciary duty as a director; provided,

however, this Article shall not eliminate or limit the liability

of a director (1) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty

to the Corporation or its stockholders; (2) for acts or omissions

not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a

knowing violation of law; (3) for the unlawful payment of

dividends or unlawful stock repurchases under Section 174 of the

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; or (4) for any

transaction from which the director derived an improper personal

         SECTION 4.01. Capital Stock. (a) The Corporation is authorized to

issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively, preferred stock and

common stock. The total number of shares which the Corporation is authorized

to issue is four hundred million (400,000,000) shares. One hundred million

(100,000,000) shares shall be designated preferred stock, par value $0.02 per

designated common stock, par value $0.02 per share (""Common Stock"") The Common

Stock of the Corporation shall be all of one class.



          (b) The number of authorized shares of any class or classes of stock

Stock, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and

as declared by the Board of Directors, out of the assets of the Corporation

which are by law available therefor, dividends payable either in cash, in

property, or in shares of stock and the holders of the Preferred Stock shall

not be entitled to participate in any such dividends (unless otherwise

provided by the Board of Directors in any resolution providing for the issue

of a series of Preferred Stock).



         SECTION 4.03.  Preferred Stock.



          (a) Series and Limits of Variations between Series. Any unissued or

series shall be issued, a certificate shall be filed with the Secretary of

State of Delaware setting forth the designation, rights, privileges,

restrictions, and conditions to be attached to the Preferred Stock of such

series and such other matters as may be required, and the Board of Directors

shall fix and determine, and is hereby expressly empowered to fix and

         SECTION 8.01. Relationship With Roche. In anticipation that the

Corporation will cease to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche Holdings,

Inc., but that Roche (as defined in Section 8.05) will remain a stockholder of

the Corporation, and in anticipation that the Corporation (as defined in

of business and have an interest in the same areas of corporate opportunities,

and in recognition of (i) the benefits to be derived by the Corporation

through its continued contractual, corporate and business relations with Roche

(including service of officers and directors of Roche as directors of the

Corporation) and (ii) the difficulties attendant to any director, who desires

and endeavors fully to satisfy such director's fiduciary duties, in

determining the full scope of such duties in any particular situation, the

provisions of this Article 8 are set forth to regulate, define and guide the

conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation as they may involve Roche and

its officers and directors, and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of

the Corporation and its officers, directors and stockholders in connection

         In the event that Roche acquires knowledge of a potential transaction

or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both Roche and the

Corporation, Roche shall have no duty to communicate or offer such corporate

opportunity to the Corporation and shall not be liable to the Corporation or

its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as a stockholder of the

Corporation or controlling person of a stockholder by reason of the fact that

Roche pursues or acquires such corporate opportunity for itself, directs such

corporate opportunity to another person or entity, or does not communicate

information regarding, or offer, such corporate opportunity to the

Corporation.



         SECTION 8.03. Corporate Opportunities. In the event that a director,

officer or employee of the Corporation who is also a director, officer or

employee of Roche acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that

may be a corporate opportunity for the Corporation and Roche (whether such

potential transaction or matter is proposed by a third-party or is conceived

of by such director, officer or employee of the Corporation), such director,

officer or employee shall be entitled to offer such corporate opportunity to

the Corporation or Roche as such director, officer or employee deems

appropriate under the circumstances in his sole discretion, and no such

director, officer or employee shall be liable to the Corporation or its

stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty or duty of loyalty or failure to

act in (or not opposed to) the best interests of the Corporation or the

derivation of any improper personal benefit by reason of the fact that (i)

such director, officer or employee offered such corporate opportunity to Roche

(rather than the Corporation) or did not communicate information regarding

such corporate opportunity to the Corporation or (ii) Roche pursues or

acquires such corporate opportunity for itself or directs such corporate

opportunity to another person or does not communicate information regarding

such corporate opportunity to the Corporation.

or more of the outstanding voting stock, voting power or similar voting

interests, and (ii) the term ""Roche"" shall mean Roche Holdings, Inc. and all

corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, associations and other entities

         SECTION 8.06. Termination; Binding Effect. Notwithstanding anything

in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the foregoing provisions

of this Article 8 shall expire on the date that Roche ceases to own

beneficially Common Stock representing at least 5% of the number of

outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation and no person who is a

director or officer of the Corporation is also a director or officer of Roche.

Neither such expiration, nor the alteration, amendment, change or repeal of

any provision of this Article 8 nor the adoption of any provision of this

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with any

provision of this Article 8 shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this

Article 8 in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or

claim that, but for this Article 8, would accrue or arise, prior to such

expiration, alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption.

         SECTION 9.01. Contracts Not Void. No contract, agreement, arrangement

or transaction (or any amendment, modification or termination thereof) between

the Corporation and Roche shall be void or voidable solely for the reason that

Roche is a party thereto, or solely because any directors or officers of the

Corporation who are affiliated with Roche are present at or participate in the

meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the

contract, agreement, arrangement, transaction, amendment, modification or

termination or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose,

but any such contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction (or any

amendment, modification or termination thereof) shall be governed by the

provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the

Corporation's Bylaws, Delaware Law and other applicable law. For purposes of

this Article 9, the terms the ""Corporation"" and ""Roche"" have the meanings set

forth in Section 8.05.

quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee that

shares of Common Stock owned by Roche may be counted in determining the

presence of a quorum at a meeting of stockholders that authorizes or approves

any such contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction (or amendment,

modification or termination thereof).

         SECTION 9.03. No Liability For Good Faith Actions. Neither Roche nor

any officer or director thereof shall be liable to the Corporation or its

any rights or gives or withholds any consent in connection with any agreement

or contract between Roche and the Corporation. No vote cast or other action

taken by any person who is an officer, director or other representative of

Roche, which vote is cast or action is taken by such person in his capacity as

a director of this Corporation, shall constitute an action of or the exercise

of a right by or a consent of Roche for the purpose of any such agreement or

contract.

purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of capital stock

or the Transferee obtains the written approval of the Board of Directors or a

duly authorized committee thereof. As a condition to granting its approval

pursuant to this Part III of Article Nine, the Board of Directors, may, in its

discretion, require (at the expense of the transferor and/or transferee) an

opinion of counsel selected by the Board of Directors that the Transfer shall

not result in a limitation on the use of the Tax Benefits as a result of the

application of Section 382 of the Code; provided that the Board may grant such

approval notwithstanding the effect of such approval on the Tax Benefits if it

determines that the approval is in the best interests of the corporation. The

Board of Directors may impose any conditions that it deems reasonable and

appropriate in connection with such approval, including, without limitation,

restrictions on the ability of any Transferee to Transfer Stock acquired

through a Transfer. Approvals of the Board of Directors hereunder may be given

prospectively or retroactively. The Board of Directors, to the fullest extent

permitted by law, may exercise the authority granted by this Article Nine

through duly authorized officers or agents of the corporation. Nothing in this

Part III of this Article Nine shall be construed to limit or restrict the

Board of Directors in the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable

law.



Part IV  Excess Securities



(a) No employee or agent of the corporation shall record any Prohibited

Transfer, and the purported transferee of such a Prohibited Transfer (the

Purported Transferee) shall not be recognized as a stockholder of the

corporation for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Corporation

Securities which are the subject of the Prohibited Transfer (the Excess

Securities). Until the Excess Securities are acquired by another person in a

Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Purported Transferee shall not

be entitled, with respect to such Excess Securities, to any rights of

stockholders of the corporation, including, without limitation, the right to

vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether

liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any, and the Excess

Securities shall be deemed to remain with the transferor unless and until the

Excess Securities are transferred to the Agent pursuant to Part V of this

Article Nine or until an approval is obtained under Part III of this Article

Nine. After the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not

a Prohibited Transfer, the Corporation Securities shall cease to be Excess

Securities. For this purpose, any Transfer of Excess Securities not in

accordance with the provisions of Parts IV or V of this Article Nine shall

also be a Prohibited Transfer.

#####  



(b) The corporation may require as a condition to the registration of the

Transfer of any Corporation Securities or the payment of any distribution on

any Corporation Securities that the proposed Transferee or payee furnish to

the corporation all information reasonably requested by the corporation with

respect to its direct or indirect ownership interests in such Corporation

Securities. The corporation may make such arrangements or issue such

instructions to its stock transfer agent as may be determined by the Board of

Directors to be necessary or advisable to implement this Article Nine,

including, without limitation, authorizing such transfer agent to require an

affidavit from a Purported Transferee regarding such Persons actual and

constructive ownership of Stock and other evidence that a Transfer will not be

prohibited by this Article Nine as a condition to registering any transfer.



Part V  Transfer to Agent



If the Board of Directors determines that a Transfer of Corporation Securities

constitutes a Prohibited Transfer then, upon written demand by the corporation

sent within thirty days of the date on which the Board of Directors determines

that the attempted Transfer would result in Excess Securities, the Purported

Transferee shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other

evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within the Purported

Transferees possession or control, together with any Prohibited

Distributions, to an agent designated by the Board of Directors (the Agent).

The Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers, which may include the

corporation, the Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more

arms-length transactions (on the public securities market on which such

Excess Securities are traded, if possible, or otherwise privately); provided,

however, that any such sale must not constitute a Prohibited Transfer and

provided, further, that the Agent shall effect such sale or sales in an

orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any

specific time frame if, in the Agents discretion, such sale or sales would

disrupt the market for the Corporation Securities or otherwise would adversely

affect the value of the Corporation Securities. If the Purported Transferee

has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the corporations demand to

surrender Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee shall be

deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be required

to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and proceeds of such

sale, except to the extent that the corporation grants written permission to

the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of such sales proceeds not

exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from

the Agent pursuant to Part VI of this Article Nine if the Agent rather than

the Purported Transferee had resold the Excess Securities.



Part VI  Application of Proceeds and Prohibited Distributions



The Agent shall apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities and,

if the Purported Transferee has previously resold the Excess Securities, any

amounts received by it from a Purported Transferee, together, in either case,

with any Prohibited Distributions, as follows: (a) first, such amounts shall

be paid to the Agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses

incurred in connection with its duties hereunder; (b) second, any remaining

amounts shall be paid to the Purported Transferee, up to the amount paid by

the Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or the fair market value

at the time of the Transfer, in the event the purported Transfer of the Excess

Securities was, in whole or in part, a gift, inheritance or similar Transfer)

which amount shall be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors;

and (c) third, any remaining amounts shall be paid to one or more

organizations qualifying under section 501(c)(3) of the Code (or any

comparable successor provision) selected by the Board of Directors. The

Purported Transferee of Excess Securities shall have no claim, cause of action

or any other recourse whatsoever against any transferor of Excess Securities.

The Purported Transferees sole right with respect to such shares shall be

limited to the amount payable to the Purported Transferee pursuant to this

Part VI of Article Nine. In no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess

Securities pursuant to this Part VI of Article Nine inure to the benefit of

the corporation or the Agent, except to the extent used to cover costs and

expenses incurred by Agent in performing its duties hereunder.

Part VII  Modification Of Remedies For Certain Indirect Transfers



In the event of any Transfer which does not involve a transfer of securities

of the corporation within the meaning of Delaware law (Securities, and

individually, a Security) but which would cause a 4.95-percent Stockholder

to violate a restriction on Transfers provided for in this Article Nine, the

application of Parts V and VI of this Article Nine shall be modified as

described in this Part VII of this Article Nine. In such case, no such

4.95-percent Stockholder shall be required to dispose of any interest that is

not a Security, but such 4.95-percent Stockholder and/or any Person whose

ownership of Securities is attributed to such 4.95-percent Stockholder shall

be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to dispose of sufficient

Securities (which Securities shall be disposed of in the inverse order in

which they were acquired) to cause such 4.95-percent Stockholder, following

such disposition, not to be in violation of this Article Nine. Such

disposition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the Transfer giving

rise to the application of this provision, and such number of Securities that

are deemed to be disposed of shall be considered Excess Securities and shall

be disposed of through the Agent as provided in Parts V and VI of this Article

Nine, except that the maximum aggregate amount payable either to such

4.95-percent Stockholder, or to such other Person that was the direct holder

of such Excess Securities, in connection with such sale shall be the fair

market value of such Excess Securities at the time of the purported Transfer.

All expenses incurred by the Agent in disposing of such Excess Stock shall be

paid out of any amounts due such 4.95-percent Stockholder or such other

Person. The purpose of this Part VII of Article Nine is to extend the

restrictions in Part II and V of this Article Nine to situations in which

there is a 4.95-percent Transaction without a direct Transfer of Securities,

and this Part VII of Article Nine, along with the other provisions of this

Article Nine, shall be interpreted to produce the same results, with

differences as the context requires, as a direct Transfer of Corporation

Securities.



Part VIII  Legal Proceedings; Prompt Enforcement



If the Purported Transferee fails to surrender the Excess Securities or the

proceeds of a sale thereof to the Agent within thirty days from the date on

which the corporation makes a written demand pursuant to Part V of this

Article Nine (whether or not made within the time specified in Part V of this

Article Nine), then the corporation may take such actions as it deems

appropriate to enforce the provisions hereof, including the institution of

legal proceedings to compel the surrender. Nothing in this Part VIII of

Article Nine shall (1) be deemed inconsistent with any Transfer of the Excess

Securities provided in this Article Nine being void ab initio, (2) preclude

the corporation in its discretion from immediately bringing legal proceedings

without a prior demand or (3) cause any failure of the corporation to act

within the time periods set forth in Part V of this Article Nine to constitute

a waiver or loss of any right of the corporation under this Article Nine. The

Board of Directors may authorize such additional actions as it deems advisable

to give effect to the provisions of this Article Nine.



Part IX  Liability



To the fullest extent permitted by law, any stockholder subject to the

provisions of this Article Nine who knowingly violates the provisions of this

Article Nine and any Persons controlling, controlled by or under common

control with such stockholder shall be jointly and severally liable to the

corporation for, and shall indemnify and hold the corporation harmless

against, any and all damages suffered as a result of such violation, including

but not limited to damages resulting from a reduction in, or elimination of,

the corporations ability to utilize its Tax Benefits, and attorneys and

auditors fees incurred in connection with such violation.

#####  



Part X  Obligation to Provide Information



As a condition to the registration of the Transfer of any Stock, any Person

who is a beneficial, legal or record holder of Stock, and any proposed

Transferee and any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control

with the proposed Transferee, shall provide such information as the

corporation may request from time to time in order to determine compliance

with this Article Nine or the status of the Tax Benefits of the corporation.



Part XI  Legends



The Board of Directors may require that any certificates issued by the

corporation evidencing ownership of shares of Stock that are subject to the

restrictions on transfer and ownership contained in this Article Nine bear the

following legend:



THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED (THE CERTIFICATE OF

INCORPORATION), OF THE CORPORATION CONTAINS RESTRICTIONS PROHIBITING THE

TRANSFER (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION) OF STOCK OF THE

CORPORATION (INCLUDING THE CREATION OR GRANT OF CERTAIN OPTIONS, RIGHTS AND

WARRANTS) WITHOUT THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE

CORPORATION (THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS) IF SUCH TRANSFER AFFECTS THE PERCENTAGE

OF STOCK OF THE CORPORATION (WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 382 OF THE INTERNAL

REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE CODE) AND THE TREASURY REGULATIONS

PROMULGATED THEREUNDER), THAT IS TREATED AS OWNED BY A 4.95 PERCENT

STOCKHOLDER (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION). IF THE TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS ARE VIOLATED, THEN THE TRANSFER WILL BE VOID AB INITIO AND THE

PURPORTED TRANSFEREE OF THE STOCK WILL BE REQUIRED TO TRANSFER EXCESS

SECURITIES (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION) TO THE

CORPORATIONS AGENT. IN THE EVENT OF A TRANSFER WHICH DOES NOT INVOLVE

SECURITIES OF THE CORPORATION WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION

LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (SECURITIES) BUT WHICH WOULD VIOLATE THE

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, THE PURPORTED TRANSFEREE (OR THE RECORD OWNER) OF THE

SECURITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO TRANSFER SUFFICIENT SECURITIES PURSUANT TO THE

TERMS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CORPORATIONS CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO CAUSE

THE 4.95 PERCENT STOCKHOLDER TO NO LONGER BE IN VIOLATION OF THE TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS. THE CORPORATION WILL FURNISH WITHOUT CHARGE TO THE HOLDER OF

RECORD OF THIS CERTIFICATE A COPY OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION,

CONTAINING THE ABOVE-REFERENCED TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO

THE CORPORATION AT ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS.



The Board of Directors may also require that any certificates issued by the

corporation evidencing ownership of shares of Stock that are subject to

conditions imposed by the Board of Directors under Part III of this Article

Nine also bear a conspicuous legend referencing the applicable restrictions.

Part XII  Authority of Board of Directors



(a) The Board of Directors shall have the power to determine all matters

necessary for assessing compliance with this Article Nine, including, without

limitation, (1) the identification of 4.95-percent Stockholders, (2) whether a

Transfer is a 4.95-percent Transaction or a Prohibited Transfer, (3) the

Percentage Stock Ownership in the corporation of any 4.95-percent Stockholder,

(4) whether an instrument constitutes a Corporation Security, (5) the amount

(or fair market value) due to a Purported Transferee pursuant to Part VI of

this Article Nine, and (6) any other matters which the Board of Directors

determines to be relevant; and the good faith determination of the Board of

Directors on such matters shall be conclusive and binding for all the purposes

of this Article Nine. In addition, the Board of Directors may, to the extent

permitted by law, from time to time establish, modify, amend or rescind by-

laws, regulations and procedures of the corporation not inconsistent with the

provisions of this Article Nine for purposes of determining whether any

Transfer of Corporation Securities would jeopardize or endanger the

corporations ability to preserve and use the Tax Benefits and for the orderly

application, administration and implementation of this Article Nine.



(b) Nothing contained in this Article Nine shall limit the authority of the

Board of Directors to take such other action to the extent permitted by law as

it deems necessary or advisable to protect the corporation and its

stockholders in preserving the Tax Benefits. Without limiting the generality

of the foregoing, in the event of a change in law making one or more of the

following actions necessary or desirable, the Board of Directors may, by

adopting a written resolution, (1) accelerate or extend the Expiration Date,

(2) modify the ownership interest percentage in the corporation or the Persons

or groups covered by this Article Nine, (3) modify the definitions of any

terms set forth in this Article Nine or (4) modify the terms of this Article

Nine as appropriate, in each case, in order to prevent an ownership change for

purposes of Section 382 of the Code as a result of any changes in applicable

Treasury Regulations or otherwise; provided, however, that the Board of

Directors shall not cause there to be such acceleration, extension or

modification unless it determines, by adopting a written resolution, that such

action is reasonably necessary or advisable to preserve the Tax Benefits or

that the continuation of these restrictions is no longer reasonably necessary

for the preservation of the Tax Benefits. Stockholders of the corporation

shall be notified of such determination through a filing with the Securities

and Exchange Commission or such other method of notice as the Secretary of the

corporation shall deem appropriate.



(c) In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of

this Article Nine, including any definition used herein, the Board of

Directors shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions

with respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or

knowledge of the circumstances. In the event this Article Nine requires an

action by the Board of Directors but fails to provide specific guidance with

respect to such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to

determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the

provisions of this Article Nine. All such actions, calculations,

interpretations and determinations which are done or made by the Board of

Directors in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the corporation,

the Agent, and all other parties for all other purposes of this Article Nine.

The Board of Directors may delegate all or any portion of its duties and

powers under this Article Nine to a committee of the Board of Directors as it

deems necessary or advisable and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may

exercise the authority granted by this Article Nine through duly authorized

officers or agents of the corporation. Nothing in this Article Nine shall be

construed to limit or restrict the Board of Directors in the exercise of its

fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Part XIII  Reliance



To the fullest extent permitted by law, the corporation and the members of the

Board of Directors shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the

information, opinions, reports or statements of the chief executive officer,

the chief financial officer, the chief accounting officer or the corporate

controller of the corporation and the corporations legal counsel, independent

auditors, transfer agent, investment bankers or other employees and agents in

making the determinations and findings contemplated by this Article Nine. The

members of the Board of Directors shall not be responsible for any good faith

errors made in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the existence

and identity of, and the amount of any Corporation Securities owned by any

stockholder, the corporation is entitled to rely on the existence and absence

of filings of Schedule 13D or 13G under the Securities and Exchange Act of

1934, as amended (or similar filings), as of any date, subject to its actual

knowledge of the ownership of Corporation Securities.



Part XIV  Benefits of This Article Nine



Nothing in this Article Nine shall be construed to give to any Person other

than the corporation or the Agent any legal or equitable right, remedy or

claim under this Article Nine. This Article Nine shall be for the sole and

exclusive benefit of the corporation and the Agent.



Part XV  Severability



The purpose of this Article Nine is to facilitate the corporations ability to

maintain or preserve its Tax Benefits. If any provision of this Article Nine

or the application of any such provision to any Person or under any

circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by

a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or

unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Article Nine.



Part XVI  Waiver



With regard to any power, remedy or right provided herein or otherwise

available to the corporation or the Agent under this Article Nine, (i) no

waiver will be effective unless expressly contained in a writing signed by the

waiving party; and (ii) no alteration, modification or impairment will be

implied by reason of any previous waiver, extension of time, delay or omission

in exercise, or other indulgence.



FOURTH: At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on March 17, 2010, held pursuant

to the notice required by Section 222 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,

not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote

thereon approved the foregoing amendment to add an Article Nine to the

Companys Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation.



FIFTH: Both of the aforementioned amendments were duly adopted in accordance

with the provisions of Section 242 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

or without cause, by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the

outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in

the election of directors of the Corporation.



ARTICLE 8. Board of Directors Vacancies



Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock

then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in

of stockholders may be taken only upon the vote of the stockholders at an

annual or special meeting duly called and may not be taken by written consent

ARTICLE 10. Special Meetings of the Stockholders



Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or

Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock

then outstanding, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may

not be called by any other person or persons.



ARTICLE 11. Annual Meetings of Stockholders



At an annual meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted,

the annual meeting (a) by, or at the direction of, a majority of the

directors, or (b) by any stockholder of the Corporation who complies with the

notice procedures set forth in this Article 11\. For a proposal to be properly

brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have

given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To

be timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received

at, the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 30 days

nor more than 60 days prior to the scheduled annual meeting, regardless of any

postponements, deferrals or



* * *



adjournments of that meeting to a later date; provided, however, that if less

than 40 days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the scheduled

annual meeting is given or made, notice by the stockholder, to be timely, must

be so delivered or received not later than the close of business on the tenth

day following the earlier of the day on which such notice of the date of the

scheduled annual meeting was mailed or the day on which such public disclosure

was made. A stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each

matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief

description of the proposal desired to be brought before the annual meeting

such stockholder to be supporting such proposal on the date of such

stockholder notice, and (d) any financial interest of the stockholder in such

proposal.



The presiding officer of the annual meeting shall determine and declare at the

annual meeting whether the stockholder proposal was made in accordance with

the terms of this Article 11. If the presiding officer determines that a

stockholder proposal was not made in accordance with the terms of this Article

11, he shall so declare at the annual meeting and any such proposal shall not

be acted upon at the annual meeting.



This provision shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval

at the annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and committees of the

Board of Directors, but, in connection with such reports, no new business

shall be acted upon at such annual meeting unless stated, filed and received

as herein provided.



ARTICLE 12. Stockholder Nomination of Directors



Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock

then outstanding, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the

following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations

of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be

made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of

Directors by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board of

Directors or by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the

election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures

set forth in this Article 12. Such nominations, other than those made by or at

the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely

notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a

stockholders notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the

principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 30 days nor more

than 60 days prior to the scheduled annual meeting, regardless of any

postponements, deferrals or adjournments of that meeting to a later date;

provided, however, that if less than 40 days notice or prior public

disclosure of the date of the scheduled annual meeting is given or made,

notice by the stockholder, to be timely, must be so delivered or received not

later than the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the

day on which such notice of the date of the scheduled annual meeting was

mailed or the day on which such public disclosure was made. A stockholders

notice to the Secretary shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the

stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director,

(i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii)

the principal occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class and

number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially

owned by the person and (iv) any other information relating to the person that

is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of

directors pursuant to Rule 14a under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

amended; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and

address, as they appear on the Corporations books, of the stockholder and

(ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporations stock which are

beneficially owned by the stockholder on the date of such stockholder notice.

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other

information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the

eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as director of the Corporation.



The presiding officer of the annual meeting shall determine and declare at the

annual meeting whether the nomination was made in accordance with the terms of

this Article 12. If the presiding officer determines that a nomination was not

made in accordance with the terms of this Article 12, he shall so declare at

the annual meeting and any such defective nomination shall be disregarded.



* * *



ARTICLE 13. Limitation of Director Liability



A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the

Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary

duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors

duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or

omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a

knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General

Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived

an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is

amended after the date hereof to authorize corporate action further

eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the

liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to

the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so

amended.



ARTICLE 14. Indemnification



(a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party

to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

administrative or investigative (hereinafter a proceeding), by reason of the

fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal

representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or

was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee

or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or

other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans

(hereinafter an indemnitee), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged

action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in

any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent,

shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest

extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists

or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to

the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader

indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide

prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including

attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts

paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such

indemnitee in connection therewith. Such indemnification shall continue as to

an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and

shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;

provided, however, that, except as provided in subparagraph (b) hereof, the

Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee seeking indemnification in

connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee

only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of

Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this

Article 14 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by

the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in

advance of its final disposition (an expense advancement); provided,

however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law so requires, the

payment of such expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a

director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in which

service was or is rendered by such indemnitee while a director or officer,

including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance

of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made upon delivery to the

Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay

all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial

decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee

is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article 14 or otherwise; and

provided, further, that no expense advancement shall be paid by the

Corporation if independent legal counsel shall advise the Board of Directors

in a written opinion that, based upon the facts known to such counsel at the

time, (a) the indemnitee acted in bad faith or deliberately breached his or

her duty to the Corporation or its stockholders, and (b) as a result of such

conduct by the indemnitee, it is more likely than not that it will ultimately

be determined that such indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct which

make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the

Corporation to indemnify such indemnitee. The Corporation may, by action of

its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the

Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of

directors and officers.



(b) If a claim under subparagraph (a) of this Article 14 is not paid in full

by the Corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by

the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against

the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in

whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to

recover an expense advancement, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid

also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. It shall be a defense

to any such action that the indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct

which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the

Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden

of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of

the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent



* * *



legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the

commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper

in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of

conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual

determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,

independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not

met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or

create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard

of conduct; provided, however, that a determination by the board of directors

denying an expense advancement based upon the written opinion of independent

legal counsel as provided for in subparagraph (a) above shall be a complete

defense to any action seeking an expense advancement, but such determination

shall not be a defense or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not

entitled to be indemnified hereunder upon the final disposition of the

proceeding.



(c) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in

defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this

Article 14 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have

or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of

Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested

directors or otherwise.



(d) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself

and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any

such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the

power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under

the Delaware General Corporation Law.



ARTICLE 15. Business Combinations



(a) For purposes of this Article 15, the following terms shall have the

meanings indicated, and all capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise

defined shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Section 203(c) of

the Delaware General Corporation Law, as in effect on the date of filing of

this Certificate of Incorporation:



(i) Business Combination shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Section

203(c)(3) of the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, that the

term interested stockholder, as used therein, shall have the meaning

ascribed to it in subparagraph (a)(iv) below.



(ii) Disinterested Shares shall mean the shares of Voting Stock of the

Corporation held by Persons other than an Interested Stockholder, and each

reference herein to a percentage or portion of the Disinterested Shares shall

refer to such percentage or portion of the votes entitled to be cast by the

holders of such Disinterested Shares.



(iii) Independent Directors shall mean the members of the Board of Directors

who were directors of the Corporation prior to any Person becoming an

Interested Stockholder or were recommended for election or elected to succeed

Stock or (2) is an Affiliate or Associate of the Corporation and was the owner

of 5% or more of the outstanding Voting Stock at any time within the three-

year period immediately prior to the date on which it is sought to be

determined whether such Person is an Interested Stockholder; and the

Affiliates and Associates of such Person. For the purpose of determining

whether a Person is an Interested Stockholder, the Voting Stock deemed to be

outstanding shall include stock deemed to be owned by the Person through

application of Section 203(c)(8) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, but

shall not include any other unissued stock of the Corporation which may be

issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon

exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.



(v) Voting Stock shall mean stock of the Corporation of any class or series

entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Corporation,

and each reference herein to a percentage or portion of shares of Voting Stock

shall refer to such percentage or portion of the votes entitled to be cast by

the holders of such shares.



* * *



(b) In addition to any affirmative vote required by applicable law or any

other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or specified in any

agreement, and in addition to any voting rights granted to or held by the

holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the approval or authorization of any

Business Combination with an Interested Stockholder that has not been approved

by a majority of the Independent Directors prior to the date that such

stockholder became an Interested Stockholder, shall require the affirmative

vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the Disinterested Shares

then outstanding.



(c) A majority of the Independent Directors shall have the power and duty to

determine, on the basis of information known to them after reasonable inquiry,

all facts necessary to determine compliance with this Article 15, including

without limitation, (i) whether a Person is an Interested Stockholder; (ii)

the number of shares of Voting Stock Owned by any Person, (iii) whether a

Person is an Affiliate or Associate of another Person, (iv) whether a proposed

transaction is a Business Combination and (v) whether a Business Combination

shall have been approved by a majority of the Independent Directors prior to

the date that a stockholder became an Interested Stockholder; and any such

determination made in good faith by a majority of the Independent Directors

shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of this Article 15.



ARTICLE 16. Board Considerations



The Board of Directors, each committee of the Board and each individual

director, in discharging their respective duties under applicable law and this

Certificate of Incorporation and in determining what they each believe to be

in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders, may consider

the effects, both short-term and long-term, of any action or proposed action

taken or to be taken by the Corporation, the Board of Directors or any

committee of the Board on the interests of (i) the employees, distributors,

lease property or conduct business, all to the extent that the Board, any

committee of the Board or any individual director deems pertinent under the

not limit in any way the right of the Board to consider any other lawful

factors in making its determinations, including, without limitation, the

effects, both short-term and long-term, of any action or proposed action on

the Corporation or its stockholders directly; and provided further that this

Article 16 shall be deemed solely to grant discretionary authority to the

Board, each committee of the Board and each individual director and shall not

be deemed to provide to any specific constituency any right to be considered.



ARTICLE 17. Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation



The Corporation reserves this right to amend, alter, change or repeal any

provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or

hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders

herein are granted subject to this reservation. In addition to any affirmative

vote required by applicable law or any other provision of this Certificate of

Incorporation, and in addition to any voting rights granted to or held by the

holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders

of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the

Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the

Corporation shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provisions

inconsistent with, the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation.

under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.



  



FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the

Corporation shall have authority to issue is Nine Hundred Eleven Million Six

Hundred Thousand (911,600,000) shares, consisting of (i) 900,000,000 shares of

* * *



Stock, par value $.01 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), (ii) 10,000,000

shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the ""Class B Common

Stock"") and (iii) 1,600,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per

share (the ""Preferred Stock""). As used in this Restated Certificate of

Incorporation, the term ""Common Stock"" shall include the Class A Common Stock

and the Class B Common Stock.



  



A. Common Stock. Except as otherwise provided herein, all shares of Class A

Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will be identical and will entitle the

holders thereof to the same rights and privileges.



  



1\. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise

provided herein, on all matters submitted to the Corporation’s stockholders,

(i) the holders of Class A Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share

and (ii) the holders of Class B Common Stock will have no right to vote.



  



2\. Dividends. When and as dividends are declared thereon, whether payable in

cash, property or securities of the Corporation, the holders of Class A Common

Stock and the holders of Class B Common Stock will be entitled to share

equally, share for share, in such dividends, provided that if dividends are

declared which are payable in shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common

Stock, dividends will be declared which are payable at the same rate on each

class of stock, and the dividends payable in shares of Class A Common Stock

will be payable to holders of Class A Common Stock, and the dividends payable

in shares of Class B Common Stock will be payable to holders of Class B Common

Stock.



  



3\. Issuance of Class B Common Stock. From and after the date of the filing of

this Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the

State of Delaware, the Corporation shall not issue or sell any Class B Common

Stock except in connection with an exchange of shares of Class A Common Stock

as provided in Section 4.2 of this Article Fourth-A.



4\. Conversion and Exchange.



  



4.1. Conversion of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock.



  



(a) Optional Conversion. Except as provided in the next sentence, each record

holder of Class B Common Stock is entitled to convert any or all of the shares

of such holder’s Class B Common Stock into the same number of shares of Class

A Common Stock, provided, that no holder of Class B Common Stock is entitled

to convert any share or shares of Class B Common Stock to the extent that, as

a result of such conversion, such holder and its Affiliates would directly or

indirectly own, control or have power to vote a greater quantity of securities

of any kind issued by the Corporation than such holder and its Affiliates are

permitted to own, control or have power to vote under any law, regulation,

order, rule or other requirement of any governmental authority at any time

applicable to such holder and its Affiliates. Other than in connection with a

registered public offering of the Class A Common Stock, no Equitable Holder

shall be entitled to convert shares of Class B



2



* * *



Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock except in connection with a

sale or transfer to a Person who is not an Affiliate of such Equitable Holder

pursuant to an automatic conversion described in paragraph (b) of this Section

4.1.



  



(b) Automatic Conversion. Upon the sale or transfer of any shares of Class B

Common Stock by the holder thereof to any Person who is not an Affiliate of

such holder, such shares of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert

without further action (an ""Automatic Conversion"") into an equal number of

shares of Class A Common Stock, provided that a distribution of shares of

Class B Common Stock by an Eligible Holder to a Regulated Holder shall not

result in an Automatic Conversion.



  



4.2. Special Exchange of Class A Common Stock for Class B Common Stock. Each

Eligible Holder is entitled to exchange a number of shares of such holder's

Class A Common Stock for the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock for

the sole purpose of a distribution by such holder to one or more of its

limited partners which is a Regulated Holder provided that the number of

shares of Class A Common Stock so exchanged does not exceed the sum of the

number of Regulated Securities for each such Regulated Holder. The subsequent

transfer of any shares of Class B Common Stock by any such Regulated Holder

shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4.1(b) of this Article Fourth-A

and such Regulated Holder shall be permitted to convert shares of Class B

Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock to the extent set forth in

Section 4.1(a) of this Article Fourth-A.



  



4.3. Certain Conversion and Exchange Procedures.



  



(a) Each conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A

Common Stock (other than an Automatic Conversion contemplated by Section

4.1(b) of this Article Fourth-A) and each exchange of shares of Class A Common

Stock for shares of Class B Common Stock will be effected by the surrender of

the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be converted or

exchanged, as the case may be, at the principal office of the Corporation or

the transfer agent designated by the Corporation, if any, at any time during

normal business hours, together with a written notice by the holder of such

shares stating either (x) the number of shares of Class B Common Stock that

such holder desires to convert into Class A Common Stock and that such

conversion shall not result in such holder and its Affiliates directly or

indirectly owning, controlling or having power to vote a greater quantity of

securities of any kind issued by the Corporation than such holder and its

Affiliates are permitted to own, control or vote under any law, regulation,

order, rule or other requirement of any governmental authority at any time

applicable to such holder and its Affiliates or (y) the number of shares of

Class A Common Stock that such holder desires to exchange for Class B Common

Stock and that such exchange is required in order for such holder to make a

distribution of shares of Common Stock to one of its limited partners which is

a Regulated Holder (and such statement will obligate the Corporation to issue

such Class B Common Stock). Such conversion or exchange will be deemed to have

been effected as of the close of business on the date on which such

certificate or certificates have been surrendered and such notice has been

received, and at such time the rights of any such holder with respect to the

converted Class B Common Stock or exchanged Class A Common Stock,



3



* * *



as the case may be, will cease and the person or persons in whose name or

names the certificate or certificates for shares of Class A Common Stock or

Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, are to be issued upon such

conversion or exchange will be deemed to have become the holder or holders of

record of the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as the

case may be, represented thereby.



  



(b) Promptly after such surrender and the receipt of the written notice

referred to in subparagraph (a) above, the Corporation will issue and deliver

in accordance with the surrendering holder's instructions the certificate or

certificates for Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as the case may

be, issuable upon such conversion or exchange and a certificate representing

any Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, which

was represented by the certificate or certificates delivered to the

Corporation in connection with such conversion or exchange but which was not

converted or exchanged. The Corporation shall be entitled to rely upon any

written notice delivered pursuant to subparagraph (a) above and such notice

shall, in the absence of manifest error, be binding and conclusive upon the

Corporation.



  



(c) From and after an Automatic Conversion, (A) each certificate formerly

representing shares of Class B Common Stock which were held by the holder

thereof or any Affiliate thereof and which were converted pursuant to such

Automatic Conversion shall thereafter be deemed to represent (1) only the like

number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which such shares of Class B

Common Stock have been converted pursuant to such Automatic Conversion (and no

Person shall thereafter have any rights in respect of such shares of Class B

Common Stock), plus (2) if all the shares of Class B Common Stock represented

by such certificate were not converted pursuant to such Automatic Conversion,

such number of shares of Class B Common Stock which were not so converted and

(B) upon any surrender for transfer of any such certificate accompanied by a

written notice certifying that an Automatic Conversion has occurred and

specifying the number of shares so converted, the Corporation will issue and

deliver (1) a certificate or certificates representing the shares of Class A

Common Stock into which such shares of Class B Common Stock have been

converted pursuant to such Automatic Conversion and (2) if all the shares of

Class B Common Stock represented by such certificate or certificates were not

converted pursuant to such Automatic Conversion, a certificate or certificates

representing such number of shares of Class B Common Stock which were not so

converted. The Corporation shall be entitled to rely on any written notice

delivered to the effect that an Automatic Conversion has occurred and such

notice shall, in the absence of manifest error, be binding and conclusive upon

the Corporation.



  



5\. Miscellaneous Provisions Applicable to Common Stock.



  



5.1. Transfers. The Corporation will not close its books against the transfer

of Class B Common Stock or Class A Common Stock in any manner that would

interfere with the timely conversion of Class B Common Stock or exchange of

Class A Common Stock.



  



5.2. Subdivisions and Combinations of Shares. If the Corporation in any



4



* * *



manner subdivides or combines the outstanding shares of one class of Common

Stock, the outstanding shares of the other class of Common Stock will be

proportionately subdivided or combined.



  



5.3. Issuance Costs. The issuance of certificates for Class A Common Stock

upon conversion of Class B Common Stock or for Class B Common Stock upon

exchange for Class A Common Stock will be made without charge to the holder or

holders of such shares for any issuance tax (except stock transfer taxes) in

respect thereof or other cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with

such conversion or exchange and the related issuance of Class A Common Stock

or Class B Common Stock, as the case may be.



  



6\. Definitions.

purpose of creating, defining, limiting and regulating the powers of the

Corporation and its directors and stockholders:



  



(a) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under

the direction of its Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of

the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by

this Restated Certificate of Incorporation directed or required to be

exercised or done by the stockholders.



  



(b) The number of directors of the Corporation shall not be less than one nor

more than fourteen and, subject to such limits, shall be fixed by resolution

duly adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors. The Board of

Directors shall be and are divided into three classes, with the terms of the

respectively, expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders held after

directors shall terminate at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, each director elected by the

stockholders after the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders shall serve for a

term expiring at the first annual meeting held after such director’s election.

Vacancies in the Board of Directors and newly-created directorships resulting

from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled as

provided in the By-Laws. The holders of a majority of the shares then entitled

to vote at an election of directors may remove any director or the entire

Restated Certificate of Incorporation otherwise provide or to the extent that

the provisions of the By-Laws would conflict with the provisions of this

Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or

restrictions of each such series of Preferred Stock in the resolution or

resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such

FOURTH, it shall be deemed to mean and include all series of the Preferred

Stock, unless the context shall otherwise require. (c) The description of the

its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions are as follows: 1. Out of the

assets of the corporation, which are by law available for the payment of

dividends remaining after full cumulative dividends upon any Preferred Stock

paid upon the Common Stock to the exclusion of the holders of Preferred Stock.

2. The holders of the Common Stock shall vote share for share, together with

provided that shares of stock having a par value shall not be issued for a

consideration less than such par value. No holders of stock of the corporation

of any class, as such, shall have any preemptive or preferential right of

subscription to any shares of any class of stock of the corporation whether

now or hereafter authorized, or to any obligations convertible into stock of

the corporation, or any right of subscription to any thereof other than such,

if any, as the Board of Directors in its discretion may, from time to time,

determine with respect thereto; and any shares of stock or convertible

obligations which the Board of Directors may determine to offer for

subscription to the holders of stock of the corporation may, as said Board

shall determine, be offered to the holders of any class or classes of stock

exclusively, or to the holders of all classes of stock, and, if offered to

more



* * *



![](exhibit31restatedcertifi005.jpg)



than one class of stock, in such proportion as between said classes of stock

as the Board of Directors in its discretion may determine. As used herein, the

expression ""convertible obligations"" shall include any notes, bonds or other

evidences of indebtedness to which are attached or with which are issued

warrants or other rights to purchase stock of the corporation of any class or

classes. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized, in its

discretion, in connection with the issue of any obligations or stock of the

corporation (but without intending hereby to limit its general power so to do

in other cases), to grant rights or options to purchase stock of the

corporation of any class upon such terms and during such period as the Board

of Directors shall determine, and to cause such rights to be evidenced by such

warrants or other instruments as it may deem advisable. At any time, or from

time to time, the corporation may grant rights or options to purchase from the

corporation any shares of its stock of any class or classes to run for such

period of time, for such consideration, upon such terms and conditions, and in

such form as the Board of Directors may determine. The Board of Directors

shall have authority, as provided by law, to determine that only a part of the

consideration, which shall be received by the corporation for the shares of

its stock which it shall issue from time to time, shall be capital, provided,

however, that, if all the shares issued shall be shares having a par value,

the amount of the part of such consideration so determined to be capital shall

be equal to the aggregate par value of such shares. The excess, if any, at any

time, of the total net assets of the corporation over the amount so determined

to be capital, as aforesaid, shall be surplus. All classes of stock of the

corporation shall be and remain at all times nonassessable. FIFTH: The minimum

of the affairs of the Corporation and its directors and stockholders: (a) A

director of the Corporation shall not in the absence of fraud be disqualified

by his office from dealing or contracting with the Corporation either as a

vendor, purchaser or otherwise, nor in the absence of fraud shall any

transaction or contract of the Corporation be void or voidable or affected by

reason of the fact that any director, or any firm of which any director is a

member, or any corporation of which any director is an officer, director or

stockholder, is in any way interested in such transaction or contract;

provided that at the meeting of the Board of



* * *



![](exhibit31restatedcertifi006.jpg)



Directors or of a committee thereof having authority in the premises,

authorizing or affirming such contract or transaction, the existence of the

interest of such director, firm or corporation is disclosed or made known and

there shall be present a quorum of the Board of Directors or of the directors

constituting such committee, and such contract or transaction shall be

approved by a majority of such quorum, which majority shall consist of

directors not so interested or connected. Nor shall any director be liable to

account to the Corporation for any profit realized by him from or through any

such transaction or contract of the Corporation ratified or approved as

aforesaid, by reason of the fact that he or any firm of which he is a member,

or any corporation of which he is an officer, director or stockholder, was

interested in such transaction or contract. Directors so interested may be

counted when present at meetings of the Board of Directors or such committee

for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum. Any contract,

transaction or act of the Corporation or of the Board of Directors or of any

committee thereof (whether or not approved or ratified as hereinabove in this

paragraph provided) which shall be ratified by a majority in interest of a

quorum of the stockholders having voting power at any annual meeting or any

special meeting called for such purpose, shall be as valid and as binding as

though ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation. (b) The number of

directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed by, and may be

amended from time to time by, resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a

majority of the whole Board except that such number shall not be less than

of the stockholders of the Corporation, each director elected shall be elected

for a one-year term and such director shall hold office until the next Annual

Meeting and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject

to prior death, resignation or removal. In no case will the manner of election

prescribed in this paragraph (b) of Article EIGHTH, or any decrease in the

number of directors constituting the whole Board, shorten the term of any

incumbent director. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an

increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the Board

of Directors then in office, and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of

Directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office,

although less than quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Notwithstanding

the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of

Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting

separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special

meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office,

interest of the Corporation; and said Board shall likewise have power to

determine in its discretion, except as herein otherwise provided, what part of

the assets of the Corporation available for dividends in excess of such

reserve or reserves shall be declared in dividends and paid to the

stockholders of the Corporation. (f) The Board of Directors shall have power

from time to time to determine to what extent and at what times and places and

under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books of the

Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of the

stockholders; and no stockholder shall have any right to inspect any account

or book or document of the Corporation, except as conferred by the laws of the

State of Delaware, unless and until authorized so to do by resolution of the

Board of Directors or of the stockholders of the Corporation. (g) Except as

otherwise provided in the By-Laws, the stockholders of the Corporation and the

Board of Directors may hold their meetings and have an office or offices

State of Delaware. (i) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the

stockholders of the Corporation must be effected as a duly called annual or

over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, special meetings of

stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the Board of Directors

pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of

Directors. (j) No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to

the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of

fiduciary duty by such director as a director; provided, however, that this

Article EIGHTH shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director to the

extent provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director's duty of

loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not

in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation

of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or

(iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal

benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this Article EIGHTH shall apply to, or

        (7)       Redemption.



                  (a)   Redemptions of  outstanding  shares of any series of the

        Preferred  Stock shall be made pursuant to the terms and  conditions set

        forth in these Amended and Restated  Articles of Incorporation or in the

        amendment  thereto  establishing  such series and,  unless they  provide

        manner as the Board of Directors may  determine,  and (ii) the notice of

        Redemption shall set forth the numbers of the certificates  representing

        provided,  then on or before the Redemption Date the  Corporation  shall

        deposit cash  sufficient to pay the  Redemption  Price of such shares in

        trust for the Benefit of the holders of the shares to be redeemed in any

        bank or trust company in the City of Richmond,  Virginia, having capital

        and surplus  aggregating at least $50,000,000 as of the date of its most

        recent  report of financial  condition  and named in such  notice,  with

        irrevocable  instructions  and  authority  to apply  such  amount to the

        Redemption of the shares so called for Redemption  against surrender for

        cancellation  of the  certificates  representing  such shares.  From and

        after the time of such  deposit all shares for the  Redemption  of which

        such  deposit  shall  have  been  so  made  shall,  whether  or not  the

        certificates  therefor shall have been surrendered for cancellation,  be

        no longer deemed to be  outstanding  for any purpose and all rights with

        respect to such shares shall  thereupon  cease and terminate  except the

        right to receive payment of the Redemption  Price, but without interest.

        Any interest accrued on such funds shall be paid to the Corporation from

        time to time.  Any fund so  deposited  and  unclaimed at the end of five

        years from the Redemption Date shall be repaid to the Corporation,  free

        of trust,  and the holders of the shares called for Redemption who shall

        not have surrendered their  certificates  representing such shares prior

        to such  repayment  shall be deemed  to be  unsecured  creditors  of the

        Corporation  for the amount of



                                       5



        the Redemption  Price and shall look only to the Corporation for payment

        thereof,  without  interest,  subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of

        Virginia.



                  (d)   The  Corporation  shall  also have the right to  acquire

        outstanding  shares of any series of the Preferred  Stock otherwise than

        by  Redemption,  from  time to time,  for such  consideration  as may be

        acceptable  to the  holders  thereof;  provided,  however,  that  if all

        Dividends  Accrued on all  outstanding  shares of such series  shall not

        have been  declared  and paid or declared and a sum  sufficient  for the

        payment  thereof set apart,  neither the  Corporation nor any Subsidiary

        shall so acquire any shares of such series except in  accordance  with a

        purchase  offer  made  on the  same  terms  to all  the  holders  of the

        outstanding shares of such series.



                  (e)   Shares of any series of the Preferred  Stock  purchased,

        redeemed or  otherwise  acquired  by the  Corporation  shall  constitute

        authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock but undesignated as to

        series,  as provided by law,  and,  unless  otherwise  provided in these

        Amended and  Restated  Articles  of  Incorporation  or in the  amendment

        thereto establishing such series of the Preferred Stock, may be reissued

        by the Corporation.



        (8)       Liquidation.  In the  event of the  voluntary  or  involuntary

liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the  Corporation,  the

holders of shares of each series of the Preferred Stock then  outstanding  shall

be  entitled  to be paid  in cash  out of the  net  assets  of the  Corporation,

including  its  capital,  an amount equal to the  Redemption  Price and no more,

before any  distribution  or payment  shall be made to the  holders of shares of

Junior Stock and after payment to the holders of the outstanding  shares of each

series of the  Preferred  Stock of the  amounts to which  they are  respectively

entitled,  the balance of such assets,  if any,  shall be paid to the holders of

Junior  Stock  according  to their  respective  rights.  For the purposes of the

preceding  sentence,  neither the  consolidation of the Corporation with nor the

merger of the Corporation  into any other  corporation,  nor the sale,  lease or

other disposition of all or substantially  all of the  Corporation's  properties

and assets shall,  without further  corporate  action,  be deemed a liquidation,

dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the  Corporation.  If the net assets

of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the holders of the outstanding shares

of each  series  of the  Preferred  Stock  the full  amounts  to which  they are

respectively  entitled, the entire net assets of the Corporation remaining shall

be distributed ratably to the holders of the outstanding shares of the Preferred

Stock in proportion to the full amounts to which they are respectively entitled.



        (9)       Conflicting  Provisions.  Subsequent to the date these Amended

and Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  become  effective the  Corporation may

issue  one or more  series of  Preferred  Stock.  In the  event  that any of the

foregoing  provisions  of these Amended and Restated  Articles of  Incorporation

conflict with the provisions of the amendment  thereto  establishing a series of

the Preferred  Stock,  then, as to such series,  the specific  provisions  which

relate to it,  and not the  general  provisions  hereinabove  set  forth,  shall

control.



                                       6



                                   ARTICLE V

                                  COMMON STOCK



     A. General.



Certain  relative  rights of the Common Stock and the holders of the outstanding

shares thereof are set forth below.



        (1)  Dividends.  Subject to the  provisions  hereinabove  set forth with

respect to the Preferred  Stock and to the provisions  contained in the Articles

of Serial  Designation  for any series of the  Preferred  Stock,  the holders of

outstanding  shares of the Common  Stock shall be entitled to receive  dividends

if,  when and as  declared  by the  Board  of  Directors  out of  funds  legally

available therefor.



        (2) Voting Rights. The holders of outstanding shares of the Common Stock

shall,  to the  exclusion  of the  holders  of any  other  class of stock of the

Corporation,  have the sole and full power to vote for the election of directors

and for all other purposes without limitation,  except (i) as otherwise provided

herein or in the Articles of Serial  Designation  as applicable to any series of

the  Preferred  Stock,  and  (ii) as may be  required  by law.  The  holders  of

outstanding  shares of the Common  Stock  shall be  entitled to one vote on each

matter to be voted upon by the  shareholders  for each share of the Common Stock

which they hold.



     B. Redesignation of Existing Common Stock.



As of the  effective  date of the Articles of  Amendment  pursuant to which this

Section B was added to these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, and

without any further action on the part of the  Corporation or its  shareholders,

each share of the Common Stock immediately  theretofore  designated Circuit City

Stock shall automatically be redesignated,  changed and converted into one share

of Common Stock.



                                   ARTICLE VI

possible. The term of office of the first class of directors shall expire at the

first annual meeting of stockholders after the initial election dividing

directors into such classes, that of the second class shall expire at the second

annual meeting after such election and that of the third class at the third

annual meeting after such election. At each annual meeting of stockholders,

successors to the class of directors whose terms shall then expire and any other

nominees for election as a director of such class shall be elected to hold

office until the third succeeding annual meeting. If the number of directors is

changed, any newly created directorships or decrease in directorships shall be

so apportioned among the classes as to make all classes as nearly equal in

number as possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the holders of one or more

series of Preferred Stock voting as a separate class shall become entitled to

elect members of the Board pursuant to the provisions of the Articles of Serial

Designation for such



                                       7



series,  the terms of all members of the Board of Directors  previously  elected

shall  expire at the time of such  election and each  director  shall then serve

until the next meeting of  stockholders  at which  directors  are  elected;  and

whenever the holders of any series of Preferred  Stock are no longer entitled to

so elect  directors  voting as a separate  class,  all of the directors shall be

elected by  classes at the next  annual  meeting of  stockholders  held for such

purpose in the manner provided hereinabove in this paragraph with respect to the

initial election dividing directors into such classes. Subject to the foregoing,

at each annual meeting of stockholders  the successors to the class of directors

whose terms shall then expire and any other  nominees for election as a director

of such class shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding  annual

meeting.  The aggregate  number of vacancies  resulting  from an increase in the

number of  directors  which may be created  and filled by action of the Board of

Directors  between  annual  meetings  of  stockholders  shall be limited to two.



                                  ARTICLE VII

     B. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.



The Corporation shall indemnify

and may contract in advance to indemnify an individual who is, was or is

threatened to be made a party to a proceeding because he is or was a director or

officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation,

is or was serving the Corporation or any other legal entity in any capacity at

the request of the Corporation against all liabilities and reasonable expenses

incurred in the proceeding except such liabilities and expenses as are incurred

because of his willful misconduct or knowing violation of the criminal



                                       8



law  (regardless  of  whether  the  proceeding  is by or in  the  right  of  the

Corporation).  The determination that indemnification  under this Paragraph B is

permissible  and  the  evaluation  as to the  reasonableness  of  expenses  in a

specific case shall be made, in the case of a director,  as provided by law, and

in the case of an officer, as provided in Paragraph C of this Article; provided,

however,  that if a majority of the  directors  of the  Corporation  has changed

after  the  date  of  the   alleged   conduct   giving   rise  to  a  claim  for

indemnification,  such  determination and evaluation shall, at the option of the

person claiming indemnification, be made by special legal counsel agreed upon by

the Board of Directors  and such person.  Unless a  determination  has been made

that indemnification is not permissible, the Corporation shall make advances and

reimbursements  for  expenses  incurred by a director or officer in a proceeding

upon receipt of an  undertaking  from him to repay the same if it is  ultimately

determined that he is not entitled to indemnification. Such undertaking shall be

an unlimited,  unsecured general obligation of the director or officer and shall

be accepted without reference to his ability to make repayment.  The termination

of a proceeding by judgment,  order, settlement,  conviction,  or upon a plea of

nolo contendere or its equivalent  shall not of itself create a presumption that

a  director  or  officer  acted in such a manner as to make him  ineligible  for

indemnification.



     C. Indemnification of Others.



The  Corporation  may,  to a  lesser  extent  or to the  same  extent  that  the

Corporation  is  required  to  provide  indemnification  and make  advances  and

reimbursements   for   expenses  to  its   directors   and   officers,   provide

indemnification  and  make  advances  and  reimbursements  for  expenses  to its

employees  and agents,  the  directors,  officers,  employees  and agents of its

subsidiaries  and predecessor  entities,  and any person serving any other legal

entity in any capacity at the request of the Corporation,  and, if authorized by

general or specific action of the Board of Directors, may contract in advance to

do  so.  The  determination  that  indemnification  under  this  Paragraph  C is

permissible,  the authorization of such indemnification and the evaluation as to

the  reasonableness  of expenses in a specific  case shall be made as authorized

from time to time by general or specific action of the Board of Directors, which

action may be taken before or after a claim for  indemnification  is made, or as

otherwise  provided by law. No person's rights under Paragraph B of this Article

shall be limited by the provisions of this Paragraph C.



     D. Miscellaneous.



Every  reference  in this  Article  to  persons  who are or may be  entitled  to

indemnification  shall  include  all persons who  formerly  occupied  any of the

positions referred to and their respective heirs,  executors and administrators.

Special legal counsel selected to make determinations  under this Article may be

counsel for the Corporation.  Indemnification pursuant to this Article shall not

be  exclusive of any other right of  indemnification  to which any person may be

entitled including indemnification pursuant to a valid contract, indemnification

by legal entities other than the Corporation and indemnification  under policies

of insurance purchased and maintained by the Corporation or others.  However, no

person shall be entitled to  indemnification by the Corporation to the extent he

is indemnified by another,  including an insurer.  The Corporation is authorized

to purchase and maintain  insurance against any liability it may have under this

Article or to protect any of the  persons  named  above  against  any  liability

arising from their service to the  Corporation  or any other legal entity at the

request of the Corporation  regardless of the  Corporation's  power to indemnify

against such liability. The provisions of this Article shall not



                                       9



be deemed to prohibit the  Corporation  from entering into  contracts  otherwise

permitted by law with any individuals or legal  entities,  including those named

above,  for the purposes of conducting the business of the  Corporation.  If any

provision of this Article or its  application to any person or  circumstance  is

held  invalid by a court of competent  jurisdiction,  the  invalidity  shall not

affect other  provisions or  applications  of this Article,  and to this and the

provisions of this Article are severable.



                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             LIMITATION OF LIABILITY



     To the full  extent  that the  Virginia  Stock  Corporation  Act, as it now

exists or is hereafter  amended,  permits the  limitation or  elimination of the

liability of directors  or  officers,  a director or officer of the  Corporation

shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages.



                                   ARTICLE IX

                            VOTE TO AMEND OR RESTATE



     As to each voting group  entitled to vote on an amendment or restatement of

these  Amended and  Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  the vote  required for

approval  shall be (i) the vote required by the Virginia Stock  Corporation  Act

(as applied without regard to the effect of clause (iii) of this Article) if the

effect of the amendment or  restatement  is (a) to reduce the  shareholder  vote

required  to approve a merger,  a  statutory  share  exchange,  a sale of all or

substantially  all of the assets of the  Corporation  or the  dissolution of the

Corporation,  (b) to modify any  provision  of Article VI of these  Amended  and

Restated  Articles  of  Incorporation,  or (c) to delete all or any part of this

clause (i) of this Article; (ii) the vote required by the terms of these Amended

and Restated Articles of  Incorporation,  as amended or as restated from time to

time,  if such terms  require the  approval of more than a majority of the votes

entitled  to be cast  thereon by such voting  group;  or (iii) a majority of the

votes  entitled to be cast thereon if neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) of this

Article is applicable.

stated  in a  resolution  or  resolutions  adopted  by the  Board  of  Directors

providing  for the creation  and issue of such rights or options,  and, in every

case,  set forth or  incorporated  by reference in the instrument or instruments

         From time to time to determine whether and to what extent,  and at what

times and places,  and under what conditions and  regulations,  the accounts and

books of the Corporation (other than the stock ledger), or any of them, shall be

open to the inspection of the  Stockholders,  and no Stockholder  shall have any

right to inspect any account or book or document of this Corporation,  except as

permitted by statute or authorized by the Board of Directors, or by a resolution

of the Stockholders;

         If the  By-Laws so  provide,  to  designate  three (3) or more of their

number to constitute an Executive Committee, which Committee shall, for the time

being, as provided in the By-Laws of the  Corporation,  have and exercise any or

all of the powers of the Board of  Directors in the  management  of the business

and affairs of this  Corporation,  and have power to authorize  the seal of this

Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it;

         Both  Stockholders  and Directors  shall have power,  if the By-Laws so

provide, to hold their meetings, either within or without the State of Delaware,

the principal office in Delaware;  and the books of the Corporation may (subject

to the  provisions of the statute) be kept outside of the State of Delaware,  at

such places as may be, from time to time, designated by the Board of Directors;

         Pursuant to the affirmative  vote of the holders of at least a majority

of the shares of stock issued and outstanding  and entitled to vote,  given at a

Stockholders'  meeting duly called for that purpose,  or when  authorized by the

written  consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock  issued and

franchises,  upon such  terms and  conditions  as its  Board of  Directors  deem

expedient and for the best interests of the Corporation;

office from dealing or  contracting  with this  Corporation  either as a vendor,

purchaser,  or  otherwise,  nor  shall  any  transaction  or  contract  of  this

         A director  shall not be personally  liable to the  corporation  or its

stockholders  for monetary  damages for breach of fiduciary  duty as a director,

except  that he may be  liable  (i) for any  breach  of the  director's  duty of

loyalty to the corporation or its  stockholders,  (ii) for acts or omissions not

in good faith or which involve intentional  misconduct or a knowing violation of

law, (iii) under Section*174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) for

the  application  of trustees in  dissolution  or of any  receiver or  receivers

appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of Section 43 of the General

Corporation  Law of the State of Delaware,  order a meeting of the  creditors or

class of creditors,  and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this

Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said Court

directs.  If a majority  in number  representing  three-fourths  in value of the

creditors  or  class  of  creditors,  and/or  of the  stockholders  or  class of

stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or

arrangement and to any reorganization of this Corporation as consequence of such

compromise  or  arrangement,  the said  compromise or  arrangement  and the said

has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors,  and/or on

all the stockholders or class of stockholders,  of this Corporation, as the case

may be, and also on this Corporation.



         ELEVENTH:  The Corporation  reserves the right to amend, alter, change,

(Originally incorporated on April 8, 1998



under the name The New Dun & Bradstreet Corporation)



FIRST: The name of the corporation is Moodys Corporation.



SECOND: The registered office of the corporation in the State of Delaware is

Law of the State of Delaware.



FOURTH: (1) The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the

10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (Preferred

(Common Stock), and (3) 10,000,000 shares of Series Common Stock, par value

$.01 per share (Series Common Stock). The number of authorized shares of any

of the Preferred Stock, the Common Stock or the Series Common Stock may be

increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then

outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting

power of the stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of

the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the

holders of any of the Preferred Stock, the Common Stock or the Series Common

Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.



(2) The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or

resolutions, to provide, out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock, for

series of Preferred Stock and, with respect to each such series, to fix the

number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such series,

the voting powers (if any) of the shares of such series, and the preferences

and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, and any

qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of such

resolutions, to provide, out of the unissued shares of Series Common Stock,

for series of Series Common Stock and, with respect to each such series, to

fix the number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such

series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of such series, and the

for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on

except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall

not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Restated Certificate of

Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any

series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock) that relates solely to the

terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock or Series Common

Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately

or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon

pursuant to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any

certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock or

Series Common Stock) or pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State

of Delaware.



(b) Except as otherwise required by law, holders of a series of Preferred

Stock or Series Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled only to such voting

rights, if any, as shall expressly be granted thereto by this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations

relating to such series).



(c) Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any

outstanding series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class or

series of stock having a preference over or the right to participate with the

Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends, dividends may be

declared and paid on the Common Stock at such times and in such amounts as the

Board of Directors in its discretion shall determine.



(d) Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation,

subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of

Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class or series of stock having

a preference over or the right to participate with the Common Stock with

respect to the distribution of assets of the corporation upon such

dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation, the holders of the

Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to receive the assets of the

corporation available for distribution to its stockholders ratably in

proportion to the number of shares held by them.

FIFTH: The Board of Directors shall be authorized to make, amend, alter,

change, add to or repeal the By-Laws of the corporation in any manner not

inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware, subject to the power of

the stockholders to amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the By-Laws made by

the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the

holders of at least 80 percent in voting power of all the shares of the

corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting

together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders to

alter, amend or repeal any provision of the By-laws which is to the same

effect as Article Fifth, Article Seventh, and Article Eighth of this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith.



SIXTH: (1) To the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of

Delaware:



(a) The corporation shall indemnify any person (and such persons heirs,

executors or administrators) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made

a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding

(brought in the right of the corporation or otherwise), whether civil,

criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal,

including appeals, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director

or officer of the corporation or, while a director or officer of the

corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a

director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation,

partnership, joint venture, trust, limited liability company or other

enterprise, for and against all expenses (including attorneys fees),

judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably

incurred by such person or such heirs, executors or administrators in

connection with such action, suit or proceeding, including appeals.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the corporation shall be required to

indemnify a person described in such sentence in connection with any action,

suit or proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such person only if the

commencement of such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) by such

person was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The

corporation may indemnify any person (and such persons heirs, executors or

administrators) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to

any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (brought in

the right of the corporation or otherwise), whether civil, criminal,

administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal, including

appeals, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent

of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a

director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation,

partnership, joint venture, trust, limited liability company or other

enterprise, for and against all expenses (including attorneys fees),

judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably

incurred by such person or such heirs, executors or administrators in

connection with such action, suit or proceeding, including appeals.



(b) The corporation shall promptly pay expenses incurred by any person

described in the first sentence of subsection (a) of this Article Sixth,

Section (1) in defending any action, suit or proceeding in advance of the

final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, including appeals, upon

presentation of appropriate documentation.

* * *



(c) The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any

person described in subsection (a) of this Article Sixth, Section (1) against

any liability asserted against such person, whether or not the corporation

would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the

provisions of this Article Sixth, Section (1) or otherwise.



(d) The provisions of this Article Sixth, Section (1) shall be applicable to

all actions, claims, suits or proceedings made or commenced after the adoption

hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or

after its adoption. The provisions of this Article Sixth, Section (1) shall be

deemed to be a contract between the corporation and each director or officer

who serves in such capacity at any time while this Article Sixth, Section (1)

and the relevant provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware and other

applicable law, if any, are in effect, and any repeal or modification hereof

shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any

state of facts or any action, suit or proceeding then or theretofore existing,

or any action, suit or proceeding thereafter brought or threatened based in

whole or in part on any such state of facts. If any provision of this Article

Sixth, Section (1) shall be found to be invalid or limited in application by

reason of any law or regulation, it shall not affect the validity of the

remaining provisions hereof. The rights of indemnification provided in this

Article Sixth, Section (1) shall neither be exclusive of, nor be deemed in

limitation of, any rights to which an officer, director, employee or agent may

otherwise be entitled or permitted by contract, this Restated Certificate of

Incorporation, vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise, or as a matter

of law, both as to actions in such persons official capacity and actions in

any other capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the

corporation that indemnification of any person whom the corporation is

obligated to indemnify pursuant to the first sentence of subsection (a) of

this Article Sixth, Section (1) shall be made to the fullest extent permitted

by law.



(e) For purposes of this Article Sixth, references to other enterprises

shall include employee benefit plans; references to fines shall include any

excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan;

and references to serving at the request of the corporation shall include

any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which

imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee,

or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or

beneficiaries.



(2) A director of the corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or

its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a

director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation

thereof is not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of

Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment,

modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect

any right or protection of a director of the corporation hereunder in respect

of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment,

modification or repeal.



4



* * *



SEVENTH: (1) The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by

or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than

three directors, the exact number of directors to be determined from time to

time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of

Directors. Commencing with the annual meeting of stockholders held in 2014,

directors shall be elected annually by the stockholders entitled to vote

thereon for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of

stockholders, provided however, that any director elected or appointed prior

to the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders shall complete the term to which

such director has been elected or appointed. The term for each director

elected at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders shall expire at the 2014

annual meeting of stockholders, the term for each director elected at the 2012

annual meeting of stockholders shall expire at the 2015 annual meeting of

stockholders, and the term for each director elected at the 2013 annual

meeting of stockholders shall expire at the 2016 annual meeting of

stockholders. The division of directors into classes shall terminate at the

2016 annual meeting of stockholders. In no case shall a decrease in the number

of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director

shall hold office until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify,

subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or

removal from office. Any newly created directorship on the Board of Directors

that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy

occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled only by a majority of the

directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining

director. If any applicable provision of the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware expressly confers power on stockholders to fill such a

directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be

filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of

the voting power of all shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally

in the election of directors voting as a single class. Any director elected to

fill a newly created directorship that results from an increase in the number

of directors shall be elected for a term expiring at the next succeeding

annual meeting of stockholders, and any director elected to fill a vacancy not

resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same

remaining term as that of his predecessor. Directors serving in a class of

directors elected for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of

stockholders following the election of such class may be removed only for

cause, and all other directors may be removed either for or without cause, and

the removal of any director, whether for or without cause, requires the

affirmative vote of at least 80 percent in voting power of all shares of the

corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting as

a single class.



(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more

series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock issued by the corporation

shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class

with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special

meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, filling of

vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the

terms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate

of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common

Stock) expressly applicable to such directorships.



5



* * *



EIGHTH: Any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of the

Common Stock of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or

special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in

writing by such holders. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to

the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common

Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the corporation may be called only

by the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation or by the Board of Directors

pursuant to a resolution approved by the Board of Directors.



NINTH: Notwithstanding anything contained in this Restated Certificate of

Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least

80 percent in voting power of all the shares of the corporation entitled to

vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single

class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Article Fifth, Article

Seventh, Article Eighth or this Article Ninth or to adopt any provision

inconsistent therewith.

         Third:  The nature of the  business  or  purposes  to be  conducted  or

""Common  Stock"")  of the par  value of $1 per  share  and  25,000,000  shares of

Preferred Stock (the ""Preferred Stock"") of the par value of $1 per share.



         A.       PREFERRED STOCK



                  The Board of Directors is expressly  authorized to provide for

the issue of all or any shares of the  Preferred  Stock,  in one or more series,

and to fix for each such  series  such voting  powers,  full or  limited,  or no

voting powers, and such designations,  preferences and relative,  participating,

optional  or other  special  rights  and  such  qualifications,  limitations  or

restrictions  thereof,  as shall be stated and  expressed in the  resolution  or

resolutions  adopted by the Board of Directors  providing  for the issue of such

series and as may be  permitted by the General  Corporation  Law of the State of

Delaware,  including, without limitation, the authority to provide that any such

series may be (i) subject to  redemption at such time or times and at such price

or prices;  (ii)  entitled  to receive  dividends  (which may be  cumulative  or

payable in preference  to, or in such relation to, the dividends  payable on any

other class or classes or any other series;  (iii)  entitled to such rights upon

the dissolution of, or upon any  distribution of the assets of, the Corporation;

or (iv)  convertible  into, or  exchangeable  for,  shares of any other class or

adjustments; all as may be stated in such resolution or resolutions.



         1.       Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series D.



         Section  1.  Designation  and  Amount.  There  shall be a series of the

Preferred  Stock of the  Corporation  which shall be  designated  as the ""Junior

Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D,"" $1.00 par value,  and the number of

shares constituting such series shall be 6,000,000. Such number of shares may be

increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors;  provided,  that

no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Junior Participating  Preferred

Stock,  Series D, to a number less than that of the shares then outstanding plus

the number of shares  issuable upon exercise of outstanding  rights,  options or

warrants or upon conversion of outstanding securities issued by the Corporation.



         Section 2.        Dividends and Distributions.



         (A)  Subject  to the prior and  superior  rights of the  holders of any

shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares

of Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock,  Series D, with respect to dividends,

the  holders of shares of Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D, in

preference to the holders of shares of Common  Stock,  par value $1.00 per share

(the ""Common  Stock""),  of the Corporation and any other junior stock,  shall be

entitled to receive,  when,  as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of

funds legally available for that purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on

the 10th day of January, April, July and October in each year (or, in each case,

if not a date on which the  Corporation  is open for business,  the next date on

which the  Corporation is so open) (each such date being referred to herein as a

""Quarterly  Dividend Payment Date""),  commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend

Payment  Date  after the first  issuance  of a share or  fraction  of a share of

Junior Participating  Preferred Stock, Series D, in an amount per share (rounded

to the nearest  cent) equal to the greater of (a) $10.00,  or (b) subject to the

provision  for  adjustment  hereinafter  set forth,  100 times the aggregate per

share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount

(payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other  distributions other than a

dividend  payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the  outstanding

shares of Common  Stock (by  reclassification  or  otherwise),  declared  on the

Common Stock, since the immediately  preceding  Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,

or, with respect to the first Quarterly  Dividend  Payment Date, since the first

issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Junior  Participating  Preferred

Stock,  Series D. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after August 4,

1997 (the ""Effective  Date"") (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in

shares of Common Stock,  (ii) subdivide the  outstanding  Common Stock, or (iii)

combine the  outstanding  Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,  then in

each such case the  amount to which  holders  of shares of Junior  Participating

Preferred Stock,  Series D, were entitled  immediately prior to such event under

clause (b) of the  preceding  sentence  shall be  adjusted by  multiplying  such

amount by a fraction  the  numerator  of which is the number of shares of Common

Stock  outstanding  immediately after such event and the denominator of which is

the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding  immediately prior to

such event.

Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D, as provided in paragraph (A)

above  immediately  after it declares a dividend or  distribution  on the Common

Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock);  provided that,

in the event no dividend or distribution  shall have been declared on the Common

Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next

subsequent  Quarterly  Dividend  Payment Date, a dividend of $10.00 per share on

the  Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D, shall  nevertheless  be

payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.



         (C) Dividends  shall begin to accrue and be  cumulative on  outstanding

shares of Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D, from the Quarterly

Dividend  Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Junior

Participating Preferred Stock, Series D, unless the date of issue of such shares

is prior to the record date for the first  Quarterly  Dividend  Payment Date, in

which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue

of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date

or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of

Junior Participating  Preferred Stock, Series D, entitled to receive a quarterly

dividend  and before such  Quarterly  Dividend  Payment  Date in either of which

events  such  dividends  shall  begin to  accrue  and be  cumulative  from  such

Quarterly  Dividend  Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid  dividends shall not bear

interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Junior Participating Preferred Stock,

Series D, in an amount less than the total amount of such  dividends at the time

accrued  and  payable  on  such  shares  shall  be  allocated   pro  rata  on  a

share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of

Directors  may fix a record date for the  determination  of holders of shares of

Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series D, entitled to receive payment of a

dividend or distribution  declared  thereon,  which record date shall be no more

than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.



         Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Junior Participating

Preferred Stock, Series D shall have the following voting rights:



         (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each

share of Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D, shall  entitle  the

holder  thereof  to  100  votes  on  all  matters  submitted  to a  vote  of the

stockholders of the Corporation.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time

after the  Effective  Date (i) declare any dividend on Common  Stock  payable in

shares of Common Stock,  (ii) subdivide the  outstanding  Common Stock, or (iii)

combine the  outstanding  Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,  then in

each such case the  number  of votes  per  share to which  holders  of shares of

Junior Participating  Preferred Stock, Series D, were entitled immediately prior

to such event  shall be adjusted by  multiplying  such number by a fraction  the

numerator  of  which  is the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  outstanding

immediately  after  such  event and the  denominator  of which is the  number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



         (B)  Except as  otherwise  provided  herein or by law,  the  holders of

shares of Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D, and the holders of

shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted

to a vote of 



                                       3

<PAGE>



stockholders of the Corporation.



         (C)     (i) If at any  time  dividends  on  any  Junior  Participating

Preferred  Stock,  Series D, shall be in  arrears in an amount  equal to six (6)

quarterly  dividends  thereon ,the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the

beginning  of a period  (herein  called a ""default  period"")  which shall extend

until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly

dividend periods and for the current quarterly  dividend period on all shares of

Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series D, then outstanding shall have been

declared and paid or set apart for  payment.  During each  default  period,  all

holders of  Preferred  Stock  (including  holders  of the  Junior  Participating

Preferred  Stock,  Series D) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six

(6) quarterly  dividends  thereon,  voting as a class,  irrespective  of series,

shall have the right to elect two (2) directors.



                  (ii)  During any  default  period,  such  voting  right of the

holders of Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D, may be  exercised

initially at a special  meeting called  pursuant to  subparagraph  (iii) of this

Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting of stockholders,  and thereafter at annual

meetings of stockholders,  provided that neither such voting right nor the right

of the holders of any other series of Preferred  Stock, if any, to increase,  in

certain cases, the authorized  number of directors shall be exercised unless the

holders of ten percent (10%) in number of shares of Preferred Stock  outstanding

shall be present in person or by proxy.  The  absence of a quorum of the holders

of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred  Stock

of such voting  right.  At any meeting at which the holders of  Preferred  Stock

shall exercise such voting right  initially  during an existing  default period,

they shall have the right,  voting as a class,  to elect  directors to fill such

vacancies,  if any,  in the Board of  Directors  as may then exist up to two (2)

directors,  or if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two (2)

directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not

amount to the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the

right to make such  increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to

permit the  election by them of the  required  number.  After the holders of the

Preferred  Stock  shall have  exercised  their right to elect  directors  in any

default  period  and  during  the  continuance  of such  period,  the  number of

directors  shall not be increased or decreased  except by vote of the holders of

Preferred  Stock as herein  provided  or  pursuant  to the  rights of any equity

securities  ranking  senior  to or pari  passu  with  the  Junior  Participating

Preferred Stock, Series D.



                  (iii) Unless the holders of Preferred  Stock shall,  during an

existing  default  period,  have  previously  exercised  their  right  to  elect

directors,  the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders

owning in the  aggregate  not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of

shares of Preferred Stock outstanding,  irrespective of series, may request, the

calling of a special  meeting of the holders of Preferred  Stock,  which meeting

shall thereupon be called by the Chairman,  President,  a Vice-President  or the

Corporate Secretary of the Corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual

meeting at which  holders of Preferred  Stock are  entitled to vote  pursuant to

this  paragraph  (C)(iii)  shall be given to each holder of record of  Preferred

Stock by  mailing a copy of such  notice to him at his last  address as the same

appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a 



                                       4

<PAGE>



time not  earlier  than 10 days and not later  than 60 days  after such order or

request or in default of the calling of such  meeting  within 60 days after such

order  or  request,  such  meeting  may  be  called  on  similar  notice  by any

stockholder  or  stockholders  owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent

(10%)  of  the  total   number  of  shares  of  Preferred   Stock   outstanding.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this  paragraph  (C)(iii),  no such special

meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days  immediately  preceding

the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.



                  (iv) In any default period,  the holders of Common Stock,  and

other classes of stock of the  Corporation if  applicable,  shall continue to be

entitled to elect the whole number of  directors  until the holders of Preferred

Stock shall have  exercised  their right to elect two (2) directors  voting as a

class,  after the  exercise of which right (x) the  directors  so elected by the

holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall

have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period,

and (y) any  vacancy  in the Board of  Directors  may  (except  as  provided  in

paragraph  (C)(ii) of this  Section  3) be filled by vote of a  majority  of the

remaining  directors  theretofore  elected by the  holders of the class of stock

which elected the director whose office shall have become vacant.  References in

this paragraph (C) to directors  elected by the holders of a particular class of

stock shall include  directors  elected by such  directors to fill  vacancies as

provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.



                  (v) Immediately  upon the expiration of a default period,  (x)

the right of the holders of Preferred Stock, as a class to elect directors shall

cease, (y) the term of any directors  elected by the holders of Preferred Stock,

as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of directors shall be such number

as may be  provided  for  in,  or  pursuant  to,  the  Restated  Certificate  of

Incorporation  or Bylaws  irrespective  of any  increase  made  pursuant  to the

provisions of paragraph  (C) (ii) of this Section 3 (such number being  subject,

however to change  thereafter  in any manner  provided by law or in the Restated

Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors

effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding  sentence may

be filled by a majority  of the  remaining  directors,  even  though less than a

quorum.



         (D)  Except  as set  forth  herein,  holders  of  Junior  Participating

Preferred Stock, Series D, shall have no special voting rights and their consent

shall not be  required  (except to the  extent  they are  entitled  to vote with

holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.



         Section 4.        Certain Restrictions.



         (A) Whenever  quarterly  dividends or other dividends or  distributions

payable on the Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock,  Series D, as provided in

Section 2 are in arrears,  thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends

and distributions,  whether or not declared,  on shares of Junior  Participating

Preferred  Stock,  Series D,  outstanding  shall  have  been  paid in full,  the

Corporation shall not:



                           (i)  declare  or pay  dividends  on,  make any  other

         distributions  on, or redeem  or  purchase  or  otherwise  acquire  for

         consideration  any  shares  of  



                                       5

<PAGE>



         stock  ranking  junior  (either as to  dividends  or upon  liquidation,

         dissolution or winding up) to the Junior Participating Preferred Stock,

         Series D;



                           (ii)  declare or pay  dividends  on or make any other

         distributions  on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to

         dividends or upon  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up),  with the

         Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock, Series D, except dividends paid

         ratably on the Junior Participating  Preferred Stock, Series D, and all

         such  parity  stock on which  dividends  are  payable  or in arrears in

         proportion to the total amounts of which the holders of all such shares

         are then entitled;



                           (iii)  redeem or  purchase or  otherwise  acquire for

         consideration  shares of any stock  ranking  on a parity  (either as to

         dividends  or upon  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding  up) with the

         Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D,  provided  that the

         Corporation  may at any time  redeem,  purchase  or  otherwise  acquire

         shares of any such parity  stock in exchange for shares of any stock of

         the  Corporation  ranking  junior  (either  as  to  dividends  or  upon

         dissolution,  liquidation  or winding  up) to the Junior  Participating

         Preferred Stock, Series D; or



                           (iv) purchase or otherwise  acquire for consideration

         any shares of Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock,  Series D, or any

         shares  of stock  ranking  on a parity  with the  Junior  Participating

         Preferred  Stock,  Series D, except in accordance with a purchase offer

         made in  writing  or by  publication  (as  determined  by the  Board of

         Directors)  to all  holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board

         of Directors,  after  consideration  of the respective  annual dividend

         rates and other  relative  rights  and  preferences  of the  respective

         series and classes,  shall  determine in good faith will result in fair

         and equitable treatment among the respective series of classes.



         (B) The Corporation  shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation

to purchase or otherwise  acquire for  consideration  any shares of stock of the

Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4,

purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.



         Section  5.  Reacquired  Shares.  Any  shares of  Junior  Participating

Preferred Stock, Series D, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in

any  manner  whatsoever  shall be  retired  and  cancelled  promptly  after  the

acquisition  thereof.  All such  shares  shall  upon their  cancellation  become

authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of

a new series of Preferred  Stock to be created by resolution or  resolutions  of

the Board of Directors,  subject to the conditions and  restrictions on issuance

set forth herein.



         Section  6.  Liquidation,  Dissolution  or  Winding  Up.  (A)  Upon any

liquidation  (voluntary  or  otherwise),   dissolution  or  winding  up  of  the

Corporation,  no  distribution  shall be made to the  holders of shares of stock

ranking  junior  (either as to dividends  or upon  liquidation,  dissolution  or

winding up) to the Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series D, unless, prior

thereto, the holders of shares of Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock, Series

D, shall have received $100 per share plus an 



                                       6

<PAGE>



amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon,  whether

or not  declared,  to the  date of  such  payment  (the  ""Series  D  Liquidation

Preference"").  Following  the  payment  of  the  full  amount  of the  Series  D

Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders

of shares of Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series D,  unless,  prior

thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per

share (the ""Common  Adjustment"")  equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i)

the Series D Liquidation  Preference by (ii) 100 (as  appropriately  adjusted as

set forth in subparagraph C below to reflect such events as stock splits,  stock

dividends and  recapitalizations  with respect to the Common Stock) (such number

in clause (ii),  the  ""Adjustment  Number"").  Following  the payment of the full

amount of the  Series D  Liquidation  Preference  and the Common  Adjustment  in

respect  of all  outstanding  shares of Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,

Series D, and holders of shares of Common Stock shall  receive their ratable and

proportionate  share of the remaining  assets to be  distributed in the ratio of

the  Adjustment  Number to 1 with  respect  to such  Preferred  Stock and Common

Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.



         (B) In the event there are not  sufficient  assets  available to permit

payment  in full of the  Series D  Liquidation  Preference  and the  liquidation

preferences  of all other series of  Preferred  Stock,  if any,  which rank on a

parity  with the  Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series  D, then such

remaining  assets  shall be  distributed  ratably to the  holders of such parity

shares in proportion to their respective liquidation  preferences.  In the event

there are not  sufficient  assets  available  to permit  payment  in full of the

Common  Adjustment,  then such remaining assets shall be distributed  ratably to

the holders of Common Stock.



         (C) In the event the Corporation  shall at any time after the execution

of the Rights  Agreement  (i) declare any  dividend on Common  Stock  payable in

shares of Common Stock,  (ii) subdivide the  outstanding  Common Stock, or (iii)

combine the  outstanding  Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,  then in

each such case the Adjustment  Number in effect  immediately prior to such event

shall be  adjusted  by  multiplying  such  Adjustment  Number by a fraction  the

numerator  of  which  is the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  outstanding

immediately  after  such  event and the  denominator  of which is the  number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



         Section 7.  Consolidation,  Merger,  etc. In case the Corporation shall

enter into any consolidation,  merger, combination or other transaction in which

the shares of Common  Stock are  exchanged  for or changed  into other  stock or

securities,  cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of

Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  Series  D,  shall at the same  time be

similarly  exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision

for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of

stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case

may be,  into  which or for which  each  share of  Common  Stock is  changed  or

exchanged.  In the event the  Corporation  shall at any time after the Effective

Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock,

(ii) subdivide the  outstanding  Common Stock,  or (iii) combine the outstanding

Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,  then in each such case the amount

set forth in the  preceding  sentence  with respect to the 



                                       7

<PAGE>



exchange or change of shares of Junior Participating  Preferred Stock, Series D,

shall be adjusted by  multiplying  such amount by a fraction  the  numerator  of

which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such

event and the  denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that

are outstanding immediately prior to such event.



         Section 8.  Redemption.  The shares of Junior  Participating  Preferred

Stock, Series D, shall not be redeemable.



         Section 9. Ranking. The Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series D,

shall rank junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock as to

the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any

such series shall provide otherwise.



         Section 10. Amendment. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the

Corporation  shall not be further  amended in any manner which would  materially

alter or  change  the  powers,  preferences  or  special  rights  of the  Junior

Participating  Preferred Stock, Series D, so as to affect them adversely without

the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the outstanding  shares

of Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series D, voting separately as a class.



         Section 11. Fractional Shares.  Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock,

Series D, may be issued in fractions of a share, which are one one-hundredths or

integral  multiples of one  one-hundredths  of a share,  which shall entitle the

holder,  in proportion to such holder's  fractional  shares,  to exercise voting

rights, receive dividends,  participate in distributions and to have the benefit

of all other rights of holders of Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock, Series

D.



         B.       COMMON STOCK



                  1.  Voting   Rights.   Except  as  provided  by  law  or  this

Certificate of Incorporation, each holder of Common Stock shall have one vote in

respect  of each  share  of  stock  held by him of  record  on the  books of the

Corporation for the election of directors and on all matters submitted to a vote

of stockholders of the Corporation.



                  2.  Dividends.  Subject  to  the  preferential  rights  of the

Preferred  Stock,  the  holders of shares of Common  Stock  shall be entitled to

receive,  when and if declared by the Board of  Directors,  out of the assets of

the Corporation which are by law available therefor, dividends payable either in

cash, in property, or in shares of capital stock.



                  3. Dissolution, Liquidation or Winding Up. In the event of any

dissolution,  liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, after

distribution in full of the preferential  amounts,  if any, to be distributed to

the  holders of shares of  Preferred  Stock,  holders of Common  Stock  shall be

entitled to receive all of the remaining  assets of the  Corporation of whatever

kind available for  distribution  to  stockholders  ratably in proportion to the

number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  held by them  respectively.  The Board of

Directors may  distribute in kind to the holders of Common Stock such  remaining

assets of the Corporation or may sell,  transfer or otherwise  dispose of all or

any part of such  remaining  assets  to any  other  corporation,  



                                       8

<PAGE>



trust or other entity and receive payment therefor in cash, stock or obligations

of such other corporation,  trust or entity, or any combination thereof, and may

sell all or any part of the consideration so received and distribute any balance

thereof in kind to holders of Common Stock.  Neither the merger or consolidation

of the  Corporation  into or with any other  corporation,  nor the merger of any

other  corporation into it, nor any purchase or redemption of shares of stock of

the Corporation of any class,  shall be deemed to be a dissolution,  liquidation

or winding up of the Corporation for the purpose of this paragraph.



         Fifth:  The  By-Laws  of the  Corporation  may be  adopted,  amended or

repealed  (a) by action of the holders of at least eighty  percent  (80%) of the

voting power of all  outstanding  Voting Stock (as defined in Article  Tenth) of

the  Corporation  entitled to vote generally at any annual or special meeting of

stockholders  or (b) by action of the Board of Directors at a regular or special

meeting  thereof.  Any By-Laws made by the Board of Directors  may be amended or

repealed by action of the  stockholders by the vote required by (a) above at any

annual or special meeting of stockholders.



         Sixth:  Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the

by-laws of the Corporation shall otherwise provide.



         Seventh:  Notwithstanding  any provision of the General Corporation Law

of the State of  Delaware,  no  action  may be taken by  stockholders  without a

meeting,  without  prior notice and without a vote,  unless a consent in writing

setting  forth the  action so taken  shall be signed by the  holders  of all the

outstanding stock who would be entitled to vote thereon.



         Eighth:  Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed  between this

Corporation  and  its  creditors  or any  class  of  them  and/or  between  this

Corporation  and its  stockholders  or any class of them, any court of equitable

jurisdiction  within the State of Delaware may, on the  application in a summary

way of this  Corporation  or of any  creditor or  stockholder  thereof or on the

application of any receiver or receivers  appointed for this  Corporation  under

the  provisions  of  Section  291 of  Title  8 of the  Delaware  Code  or on the

application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed

for this  Corporation  under the  provisions  of  Section  279 of Title 8 of the

Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors,  and/or of

the stockholders or class of stockholders of this  Corporation,  as the case may

be, to be summoned in such  manner as the said court  directs.  If a majority in

number  representing  three-fourths  in  value  of the  creditors  or  class  of

creditors,  and/or  of  the  stockholders  or  class  of  stockholders  of  this

Corporation,  as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement  and to

any  reorganization  of this  Corporation as  consequence of such  compromise or

arrangement,  the said  compromise or  arrangement  and the said  reorganization

shall,  if sanctioned by the court to which the said  application has been made,

be  binding on all the  creditors  or class of  creditors,  and/or on all of the

stockholders or class of stockholders,  of this Corporation, as the case may be,

and also on this Corporation.



         Ninth: The Corporation  reserves the right to amend,  alter,  change or

repeal any provision  contained in this  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  in the

manner now or hereafter  prescribed by statute,  and all rights  conferred  upon

stockholders herein are granted 



                                       9

<PAGE>



subject to this reservation.



         Tenth: 1. Higher Vote for Certain Business Combinations. In addition to

any  affirmative  vote of holders  of a class or series of capital  stock of the

Corporation  required by law or this  Certificate,  a Business  Combination  (as

hereinafter defined) with or upon a proposal by a Related Person (as hereinafter

defined)  shall require the  affirmative  vote of the holders of at least eighty

percent  (80%)  of  the  voting  power  of  all  outstanding  Voting  Stock  (as

hereinafter defined) of the Corporation, voting together as a single class. Such

affirmative votes shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be

required, or that a lesser percentage may be specified, by law or the Board.



              2.  When  Higher  Vote Is Not  Required.  The  provisions  of this

Article shall not be applicable to a particular Business  Combination,  and such

Business  Combination shall require only such affirmative vote as is required by

law  and  any  other  provision  of  this  Certificate  or  the  By-Laws  of the

Corporation,  if all of the  conditions  specified  in any one of the  following

Paragraphs (A), (B) or (C) are met:



                      (A) Approval by Directors.  The Business  Combination  has

been  approved  by a vote of a  majority  of all the  Continuing  Directors  (as

hereinafter defined); or



                      (B) Combination with Subsidiary.  The Business Combination

is solely between the  Corporation  and a subsidiary of the Corporation and such

Business  Combination  does not have the direct or indirect  effect set forth in

Paragraph 3(B)(v) of this Article Tenth; or



                      (C) Price and Procedural Conditions. The proposed Business

Combination  will be  consummated  within three years after the date the Related

Person  became  a  Related  Person  (the  ""Determination  Date"")  and all of the

following conditions have been met:



                          (i) The  aggregate  amount  of (x)  cash  and (y) fair

market value (as of the date of the consummation of the Business Combination) of

consideration  other than cash,  to be received per share of Common or Preferred

Stock of the  Corporation in such Business  Combination by holders thereof shall

be at least  equal to the  highest  per share  price  (including  any  brokerage

commissions,  transfer taxes and  soliciting  dealers' fees) paid by the Related

Person for any shares of such class or series of stock acquired by it; provided,

that if either  (a) the  highest  preferential  amount  per share of a series of

Preferred  Stock to which the holders  thereof would be entitled in the event of

any  voluntary or  involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding-up of the

affairs of the Corporation (regardless of whether the Business Combination to be

consummated  constitutes  such an event) or (b) the highest reported sales price

per share for any  shares of such  series  of  Preferred  Stock on any  national

to the



ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION



of



CENTURYLINK, INC.



(Pursuant to Sections 1--602, 1005(8) and 1006 of the



Louisiana Business Corporation Act)



These articles of amendment (Articles of Amendment) to the articles of

incorporation (Articles of Incorporation) of CENTURYLINK, INC., a Louisiana

business corporation (Corporation), have been prepared for filing with the

Secretary of State of Louisiana pursuant to Sections 12:1-602, 1005(8) and

1006 of the Louisiana Business Corporation Act (the Act), R.S. 12:1-101 et

seq., to set forth the following:



FIRST: At a meeting duly called and held on February 13, 2019, the Board of

Directors of the Corporation unanimously approved and adopted the following

amendment of the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, as set forth

below. Shareholder approval was not required for this amendment.



SECOND: ARTICLE III of the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation is

hereby amended to add Section F, Series CC Junior Participating Preferred

Shares. The text of this amendment is as follows:



F. Series CC Junior Participating Preferred Shares:



(1) Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be designated as

Series CC Junior Participating Preferred Shares (the Series CC Shares) and

the number of shares constituting the Series CC Shares shall be 150,000. Such

number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of

Directors; provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of Series CC

Shares to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the

number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding

options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding

securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Series CC Shares.



(2) Dividends and Distributions.



(a) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of

Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the

Series CC Shares with respect to dividends, the holders of Series CC Shares

shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of

Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends

payable in cash on the dividend date declared on the Common Stock, par value

$1.00 per share (the Common Stock) in each year (each such date being

referred to herein as a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date), commencing on the

first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or

fraction of a share of Series CC Shares, in an amount per share (rounded to

the nearest cent), subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set

forth, equal to 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash

dividends, and 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind)

of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, declared on the Common Stock

of the Corporation since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the

first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series CC Shares, other

than, in each case, a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a

subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or

otherwise). In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any

dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a

subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of

Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend

in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common

Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of Series CC Shares

were entitled immediately prior to such event under the preceding sentence

shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of

which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after

such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common

Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



* * *



(b) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series CC

Shares as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section immediately after it

declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend

payable in shares of Common Stock).



(c) Dividends, to the extent payable as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of

this Section, shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding Series CC

Shares from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of

issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the

record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case

dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such

shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is

a date after the record date for the determination of holders of Series CC

Shares entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to

accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued

but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the Series CC

Shares in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time

accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-

share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of

Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of Series CC

Shares entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared

thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date

fixed for the payment thereof.



(3) Voting Rights. The holders of Series CC Shares shall have the following

voting rights:



(a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share

of Series CC Shares shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes on all

matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the

event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the

Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or

combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of

Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then

in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of Series CC

Shares were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by

multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the

denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other articles of amendment

creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the

holders of Series CC Shares and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any

other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote

together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of

the Corporation.



(c) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of

Series CC Shares shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall

not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders

of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.



(4) Certain Restrictions.



(a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable

on the Series CC Shares as provided in Article III.F.(2) are in arrears,

thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions,

whether or not declared, on Series CC Shares outstanding shall have been paid

in full, the Corporation shall not:



(i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares

of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

dissolution or winding up) to the Series CC Shares;



(ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares

of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

dissolution or winding up) with the Series CC Shares, except dividends paid

ratably on the Series CC Shares and all such parity stock on which dividends

are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the

holders of all such shares are then entitled;



* * *



(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any

stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution

or winding up) to the Series CC Shares, provided that the Corporation may at

any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock

in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either

as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series

CC Shares; or



(iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any Series CC

Shares, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series CC Shares,

except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication

(as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon

such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective

annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the

respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in

fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.



(b) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to

purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the

Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (a) of this Articles

III.F.(4), purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such

manner.



(5) Reacquired Shares. Any Series CC Shares purchased or otherwise acquired by

the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled

promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their

cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may

be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the

conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Articles of

Incorporation, or in any other Articles of Amendment to the Articles of

Incorporation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as

otherwise required by law.



(6) Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation, dissolution

or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the

holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon

liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series CC Shares unless, prior

thereto, the holders of Series CC Shares shall have received $10,000 per

share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions

thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that

the holders of Series CC Shares shall be entitled to receive an aggregate

amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set

forth, equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share

to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock

ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution

or winding up) with the Series CC Shares, except distributions made ratably on

the Series CC Shares and all such parity stock in proportion to the total

amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such

liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at

any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of

Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the

outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by

payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser

number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount

to which holders of Series CC Shares were entitled immediately prior to such

event under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be

adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is

the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event

and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



(7) Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any

consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of

Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash

and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series CC

Shares shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount

per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth,

equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or

any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for

which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the

Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock

payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or

consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification

or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a

greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the

amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or

change of Series CC Shares shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a

fraction, the numerator of



* * *



which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after

such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common

Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



(8) No Redemption. The Series CC Shares shall not be redeemable.



(9) Rank. The Series CC Shares shall rank, with respect to the payment of

dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other

class of the Corporations Preferred Stock.



(10) Amendment. The Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be

amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers,

preferences or special rights of the Series CC Shares so as to affect them

adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds

of the outstanding Series CC Shares, voting together as a single class.

any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided:



(1) The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the

corporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The number of directors

which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed by, or in

the manner provided in, the Bylaws. The phrase whole Board and the phrase

the total number of directors which the corporation would have if there were

no vacancies. No election of directors need be by written ballot except and to

the extent provided in the Bylaws of the corporation.



(2) After the original or other Bylaws of the corporation have been adopted,

amended, or repealed, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of

Section 109 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and,

after the corporation has received any payment for any of its stock, the power

to adopt, amend, or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation may be exercised by

the Board of Directors of the corporation; provided, however, that any

provision for the classification of directors of the corporation for staggered

terms pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of Section 141 of the

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall be set forth in the

original Bylaws or in Bylaws adopted by the stockholders entitled to vote of

the corporation unless provisions for such classification shall be set forth

in this certificate of incorporation.



(3) Whenever the corporation shall be authorized to issue only one class of

stock, each outstanding share shall entitle the holder thereof to notice of,

and the right to vote at, any meeting of stockholders. Whenever the

corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock, no

outstanding share of any class of stock which is denied voting power under the

provisions of the certificate of incorporation shall entitle the holder

thereof to the right to vote at any meeting of stockholders except as the

provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of Section 242 of the General

Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall otherwise require; provided,

that no share of any such class which is otherwise denied voting power shall

entitle the holder thereof to vote upon the increase or decrease in the number

of authorized shares of said class.



ELEVENTH: The personal liability of the directors of the corporation is hereby

eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the provisions of paragraph (7)

of subsection (b) of Section 102 of the General Corporation Law of the State

of Delaware, as the same may be amended and supplemented.



TWELFTH: The corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the

provisions of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of

Delaware, as the same may be amended and supplemented, indemnify any and all

persons whom it shall have power to indemnify under said section from and

against any and all of the expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to

in or covered by said section, and the indemnification provided for herein

shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified

may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or

disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons

official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such

office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,

officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,

executors, and administrators of such person.



THIRTEENTH: From time to time any of the provisions of this certificate of

incorporation may be amended, altered, or repealed, and other provisions

authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be

added or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and

all rights at any time conferred upon the stockholders of the corporation by

this certificate of incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of

this Article THIRTEENTH.



FOURTEENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by Section 122(17) of the DGCL,

the corporation, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any

interest or expectancy of the corporation and its subsidiaries in, or in being

offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities that are from

time to time presented to any of the Sponsors or any of their respective

officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and

subsidiaries (other than the corporation and its subsidiaries), even if the

opportunity is one that the corporation or its subsidiaries might reasonably

be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted

the opportunity to do so and no such person shall be liable to the corporation

or any of its subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a

director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person

pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business

opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity,

or information regarding such business opportunity, to the corporation or its

subsidiaries unless, in the case of any such person who is a director or

officer of the corporation, such business opportunity is expressly offered to

such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a

director or officer of the



* * *



corporation. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any

shares of stock of the corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and

consented to the provisions of this Article FOURTEENTH. Neither the

alteration, amendment or repeal of this Article FOURTEENTH nor the adoption of

any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this

Article FOURTEENTH shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article

FOURTEENTH in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or

claim that, but for this Article FOURTEENTH, would accrue or arise, prior to

such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption.



FIFTEENTH: Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

shall not apply to the corporation.

(Directors)



9.1. Number, Vacancies. The number of directors of the corporation shall be

such number, not less than 5 nor more than 25 (exclusive of directors, if any,

to be elected by holders of preferred stock of the corporation, voting

separately as a class), as shall be provided from time to time in or in

accordance with the Bylaws; provided, however, that no decrease in the number

of directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent

director, and provided further that no action shall be taken to decrease or

increase the number of directors from time to time unless at least two-thirds

of the directors then in office shall concur in said action. Vacancies in the

board of directors of the corporation, however caused, and newly created

directorships shall be filled by a vote of two-thirds of the directors then in

office, whether or not a quorum, and any director so chosen shall hold office

for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders at which the term of

the class to which the director has been chosen expires and when the

directors successor is elected and qualified.



9.2 Classified Board. The board of directors of the corporation shall be

divided into three classes of directors which shall be designated Class 1,

Class 2 and Class 3. The members of each class shall be elected for a term of

three years and until their successors are elected and qualified. Such classes

shall be as nearly equal in number as the then total number of directors

constituting the entire board of directors shall permit, with the terms of

office of all members of one class expiring each year. Subject to the

provisions of Section 9.1, should the number of directors not be equally

divisible by three, the excess director or directors shall b assigned to

Classes 2 or 3 as follows: (i) if there shall be an excess of one directorship

over a number equally divisible by three, such extra directorship shall be

classified in Class 3; and (ii) if there be an excess of two directorships

over a number equally divisible by three, one shall be classified in Class 2

and the other in Class 3. At the first annual meeting of stockholders,

directors in class 1 shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at

the third succeeding annual meeting thereafter. At the second annual meeting

of stockholders, directors of Class 2 shall be elected to hold office for a

term expiring at the third succeeding meeting thereafter. At the third annual

meeting of stockholders, directors of Class 3 shall be elected to hold office

for a term expiring at the third succeeding meeting thereafter. Thereafter, at

each succeeding annual meeting, directors of each class shall be elected for

three year terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the director whose term shall

expire at any annual meeting shall continue to serve until such time as his

successor shall have been duly elected and shall have qualified unless his

position on the board of directors shall have been abolished by action taken

to reduce the size of the board of directors prior to said meeting.



* * *



Should the number of directors of the corporation be reduced, the

directorship(s) eliminated shall be allocated among classes as appropriate so

that the number of directors in each class is as specified in the immediately

preceding paragraph. The board of directors shall designate, by the name of

the incumbent(s), the position(s) to be abolished. Notwithstanding the

foregoing, no decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of

shortening the term of any incumbent director. Should the number of directors

of the corporation be increased, the additional directorships shall be

allocated among classes as appropriate so that the number of directors in each

class is as specified in the immediately preceding paragraph.



Whenever the holders of any one or more series of preferred shock of the

corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one

or more directors of the corporation, the board of directors shall consist of

said directors so elected in addition to the number of directors fixed as

provided in Section 9.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as

otherwise may be required by law, whenever the holders of any one or more

series of preferred stock of the corporation shall have the right, voting

separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the corporation, the

terms of the director or directors elected by such holders shall expire at the

next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders.

the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding

shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the

meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose. Notwithstanding the

foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock

of the corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to

elect one or more directors of the corporation, the preceding provisions of

this Article 11 shall not apply with respect to the director or directors

elected by such holders of preferred stock.



ARTICLE 12



(Acquisition of Capital Stock)



12.1 Five Year Prohibition. For a period of five years from the effective date

of the completion of the conversion of Heritage Savings Bank to become a

wholly-owned subsidiary of this corporation, no person shall directly or

indirectly offer to acquire or acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10%

of any class of equity security of the corporation, unless such offer or

acquisition shall have been approved in advance by two-thirds vote of the

Continuing Directors, as defined in Article 14. In addition, for a period for

five years from the completion of the conversion of Heritage Savings Bank to

become a wholly-owned subsidiary of this corporation upon such conversion, and

notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Articles of

Incorporation or in the Bylaws of the corporation, where any person directly

or indirectly acquires beneficial ownership of more than 10% of any class of

equity security of the corporation in violation of this Article 12, the

securities beneficially owned in excess of 10% shall not be counted as shares

entitled to vote shall not be voted by any person or counted as voting shares

in connection with any matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote, and

shall not be counted as outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum or

the affirmative vote necessary to approve any matter submitted to the

stockholders for a vote.



12.2 Prohibition after Five Years. If, at any time after five years from the

effective date of the completion of the conversion of Heritage Savings Bank to

become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the corporation upon such conversion, any

person shall acquire the beneficial ownership of more than 10% of any class of

equity security of the Corporation without the prior approval by a two-thirds

vote of the Continuing Directors (as defined in Article 14), Then the record

holders of voting stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such

acquiring person shall have only the voting rights set forth in this Section

12.2 on any matter requiring their vote or consent. With respect to each vote

in excess of 10% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of voting stock

of the corporation which such record holders would otherwise be entitled to

cast without giving effect to this Section 12.2, the record holders in the

aggregate shall be entitled to cast only one-hundredth of a vote, and the

aggregate voting power of such record holders, so limited for all shares of

voting stock of the corporation beneficially owned by such acquiring person,

shall be allocated proportionately among such record holders. For each such

record holder, this allocation shall be accomplished by multiplying the

aggregate voting, as so limited, of the outstanding shares of voting stock of

the corporation beneficially owned by such acquiring person by a fraction

whose numerator is the number of votes represented by the shares of voting

stock of the corporation that are beneficially owned simultaneously by more

than one person shall have, with respect to such shares, the right to cast the

least number of votes that such person would be entitled to cast under this

Section 12.2 by virtue of such shares being so beneficially owned by any of

such acquiring persons.



Section 12.3 Definitions. The term person means an individual, a group

acting in concert, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

resale of such securities, no such underwriter or member of such selling group

is a beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of equity security of the

corporation, (ii) any proxy granted to one or more Continuing Directors (as

defined in Article 14) by a stockholder of the corporation or (iii) any

subsidiary thereof or by virtue of the Continuing Directors of the

corporation, the officers and employees of the corporation and its

subsidiaries and the directors of subsidiaries of the corporation being

fiduciaries or beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan of the corporation or

subsidiary of the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no director,

officer or employee of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries or group of

any of them shall be exempt from the provisions of this Article 12 should any

such person or group become a beneficial owner or more than 10% of any class

or equity security of the corporation.



Section 12.5 Determinations. A majority of the continuing Directors (as

defined in Article 14) shall have the power to construe and apply the

provisions of the Article and to make all determinations necessary or

desirable to implement such provisions, including but not limited to matters

with respect to (i) the number of shares beneficially owned by any person,

(ii) whether a person has an agreement arrangement, or understanding with

another as to the matters referred to in the definition of beneficial

ownership, (iii) the application of any other definition or operative

provision of this Article 12 to the given facts or (iv) any other matter

relating to the applicability or effect of this Article 12 in good faith and

on the basis of such information and assistance as was then reasonably

available for such purpose shall be conclusive and binding upon the

corporation and its stockholders.

NINTH: The provisions of the Mississippi Shareholder Protection Act, Sections

79-25-1 through 79-25-9, Mississippi Code 1972 Annotated (the ‘Act’), without

regard to any future amendments thereto but with the modifications set forth

below, shall apply to this Corporation as if the Corporation was a

‘Corporation’ as defined in the Act. The following modifications shall apply:



A. The 80% vote required by Section 79-25-5(a) of the Act shall not apply, and

the only vote required by this Article NINTH shall be the two-thirds vote

required by Section 79-25-5(b).



B. The term ‘Beneficial Owner’ is defined as follows for all purposes of this

Article NINTH rather than as it is defined in Section 79-25-3(d) of the Act.



1\. ‘Beneficial Owner’, when used with respect to any voting stock, means any

person (i) that, individually or with any of its affiliates or associates,

beneficially owns voting stock, directly or indirectly; or (ii) that,

individually or with any of its affiliates or associates, has: (A) the right

to acquire voting stock (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only

after the passage of time), pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or

understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights,

warrants or options, or otherwise; provided, however, that a person shall not

be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, voting stock

tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by or on behalf of such

person or any of such person’s Affiliates or Associates until such tendered

voting stock is accepted for purchase or exchange; or (B) the right to vote

voting stock pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding;

provided, however, that a person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of,

or to beneficially own, any voting stock if the agreement, arrangement or

understanding to vote such stock (1) arises solely from a revocable proxy or

consent given to such person in response to a public proxy or consent

solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules

and regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

amended, and (2) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D under that Act

(or any comparable or successor report); or (iii) that has any agreement,

arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting,

exercising investment power over, or disposing of voting stock with any other

person that beneficially owns, or whose affiliates or associates beneficially

own, directly or indirectly, such shares of voting stock.



2\. Notwithstanding anything in this definition of beneficial ownership to the

contrary, the phrase ‘then outstanding,’ when used with reference to a

person’s beneficial ownership of voting stock of the Corporation, shall mean

the number of such voting stock not then actually issued and outstanding which

such person would be deemed to own beneficially hereunder.



3\. Further notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining as of any particular

time whether any member of the Sanderson Family (as such term is defined in

paragraph 5 hereof) beneficially owns voting stock of the Corporation, such

member shall not be considered to be the beneficial owner of any share that

constitutes a Family Share (as herein defined) at that time, even if such

share would, in the absence of this paragraph, be deemed to be beneficially

owned by such member. A ‘Family Share’ is a share that meets the description

set forth in any of clauses (i) through (iv) below and that, at the time as of

which a determination of beneficial ownership is to be made, continues to be a

Family Share pursuant to the provisions that follow those clauses. A share is

initially a ‘Family Share’ if: (i) on the date this Article NINTH becomes

effective (‘Effective Date’), all or substantially all of the economic benefit

of owning such share is enjoyed by one or more members of the Sanderson

Family; or (ii) such share is distributed after the Effective Date with

respect to a share that is a Family Share on the date of such distribution, in

connection with any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization or similar

transaction affecting all shares of the same class or series as the share with

respect to which such distributed share is distributed; or (iii) such share is

issued after the Effective Date upon exercise of any warrant, right or option

that is distributed with respect to a share that is a Family Share on the date

of such distribution, provided that



  



02110900 4



* * *



  



  



such distribution is made to all holders of shares of the same class or series

as the share with respect to which such warrant, right or option is

distributed, and further provided that at all times after such distribution of

such warrant, right or option through the date of issuance of the share all or

substantially all of the economic benefit of ownership of such warrant, right

or option continues to be enjoyed, without interruption, by any one or more

members of the Sanderson Family (regardless of any transfer of economic

enjoyment from any such member to any other such member); or (iv) all or

substantially all of the economic benefit of ownership of such share is

acquired at any time by a member of the Sanderson Family pursuant to the

Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust Agreement of Sanderson Farms, Inc. and

Affiliates (the ‘ESOP’) or pursuant to any employee benefit plan of the

Company approved by the Board of Directors, and which is available without

discrimination either to all employees or all key employees of the

Corporation. A share that is a ‘Family Share’ initially, in accordance with

the preceding sentence, continues to be a ‘Family Share’ thereafter only for

so long as all or substantially all of the economic benefit of ownership

continues, without interruption, to be enjoyed by any one or more members of

the Sanderson Family (regardless of any transfer of economic benefit from any

such member to any other such member). A share ceases to be a ‘Family Share’

if all or substantially all of the economic benefit of ownership is

transferred to, or becomes held by, a person who or which is not a member of

the Sanderson Family. Once a share ceases to be a ‘Family Share’ it does not

thereafter become a ‘Family Share’ even if the economic benefit of its

ownership is reacquired by a member of the Sanderson Family, unless such

reacquisition is pursuant to a distribution or exercise of the type described

in clause (ii) or (iii) above, or is from the ESOP or any employee benefit

plan of the type described in clause (iv) above. For all purposes of

determining whether a share is or remains a Family Share, shares shall not be

considered to be fungible. The economic benefit of ownership of a share is

deemed to be enjoyed by the person or persons who are the principal

beneficiaries of dividends and other distributions made with respect to such

share and of the proceeds of any sale of such share. The beneficiary of a

trust, and not the trustee, enjoys the economic benefit of a share owned by

the trust. Similarly, the participant in any employee benefit plan that owns a

share allocated to that participant, and not the trustee or plan

administrator, enjoys the economic benefit of ownership of that share. The

economic benefit of a share held by a corporation is enjoyed by that

corporation and not by its shareholders.



4\. Solely for the purposes of this Article NINTH, notwithstanding the

foregoing, all shares which would, but for the special provisions set forth in

paragraph 3 hereof, be deemed to be beneficially owned by such member of the

Sanderson Family (without regard to manner or time of acquisition) shall be

deemed beneficially owned by such member (i) for purposes of receiving payment

for shares held by such member from an Interested Shareholder in a business

combination pursuant to the terms of the Act; or (ii) after such time as such

member is, in accordance with the above rules for determining beneficial

ownership, deemed to be an Interested Shareholder pursuant to the Act and this

Article NINTH.



5\. Voting stock that, pursuant to the foregoing, is not deemed beneficially

owned by a member of the Sanderson Family shall nevertheless be considered to

be outstanding shares for purposes of calculating beneficial ownership

percentages by such member of shares that are deemed beneficially owned by

such member, and for purposes of calculating beneficial ownership of other

persons. For purposes of this article NINTH, ‘Sanderson Family’ shall mean the

children and grandchildren of D.R. Sanderson and Wilma W. Sanderson and the

spouses of such children, but not the spouses of such grandchildren and shall

also mean the estate of any of the foregoing persons.



C. The supermajority vote required by the Act shall not apply to a business

combination which has been approved by at least two-thirds of the Continuing

Directors, and not by 80% of the Continuing Directors as provided in Section

79-25-7(c) of the Act.



  



02110900 5



* * *



  



  



D. No amendment to this Article NINTH shall apply to any Business Combination

with an Interested Shareholder who was an Interested Shareholder either on the

date on which such amendment is proposed by the Board of Directors, or on the

date on which such amendment is approved by the stockholders, unless such

amendment (i) shall have been recommended to the stockholders in advance of

adoption by the vote of at least two-thirds of the full Board of Directors of

the Corporation at a time when no person, corporation or other entity

beneficially owns 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the

Corporation or 20% or more of the total voting power of the Corporation

entitled to vote with respect to such amendment, or (ii) is approved by at

least two-thirds of the Continuing Directors.



TENTH: Any amendment to Articles SEVENTH, NINTH, TENTH, TWELFTH, or THIRTEENTH

of these Articles of Incorporation shall require the affirmative vote of at

least two-thirds of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (in

addition to, and not in lieu of, any other vote required under the Mississippi

Business Corporation Act); provided that such two-thirds vote shall not be

required for any such amendment which is recommended to the stockholders in

advance of adoption by the vote of at least two-thirds of the full Board of

Directors of the Corporation at a time when no person, corporation or other

entity beneficially owns (for which purpose the definition of ‘beneficial

ownership’ set forth in Article NINTH on the date on which this Article TENTH

becomes effective (without regard to any amendment to Article NINTH, unless

specifically incorporated into this Article TENTH) shall apply, but without

regard to paragraph 4 of Section ‘B’ thereof) 20% or more of the outstanding

shares of Common Stock of the Corporation or 20% or more of the total voting

power of the Corporation entitled to vote with respect to such amendment.



ELEVENTH: The Board of Directors is authorized to adopt, and amend from time

to time, a By-law that increases, over the percentage otherwise required by

the Mississippi Business Corporation Act, the percentage ownership of all of

the votes entitled to be cast on the issue to be considered at a special

meeting that is necessary to call a special meeting of stockholders, and the

percentage set forth in such By-law shall be deemed to be set forth herein.



TWELFTH: Any merger, consolidation, share exchange, combination of shares,

sale of substantially all of the Corporation’s assets other than in the

regular course of business or adoption of a plan of dissolution of the

Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the

total Common Stock outstanding and the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds

of all of the votes entitled to be cast on such transaction by each voting

group entitled to vote separately thereon.



THIRTEENTH: Any director of the Corporation elected or appointed by the

stockholders of the Corporation or by its Board of Directors may be removed

only by the vote of not less than two-thirds of the total outstanding Common

Stock. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors resulting from the removal of a

director as provided in this Article THIRTEENTH shall be filled by the

stockholders; provided that, if the stockholders fail to fill any such vacancy

within 90 days of the date that the director was removed, then the Board of

Directors may fill such vacancy. No amendment hereto shall apply during any

term of office that commenced prior to such amendment, unless such amendment

specifically provides that it shall apply during any such term of office and

is recommended to the stockholders in advance of adoption by the vote of at

least two-thirds of the full Board of Directors of the Corporation at a time

when no person, corporation or other entity beneficially owns (for which

purpose the definition of ‘beneficial ownership’ set forth in Article NINTH on

the date on which this Article THIRTEENTH becomes effective (without regard to

any amendments to Article NINTH, unless specifically incorporated into this

Article THIRTEENTH) shall apply, but without regard to paragraph 4 of Section

‘B’ thereof) 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the

Corporation or 20% or more of the total voting power of the Corporation

entitled to vote with respect to such amendment. Notwithstanding the

foregoing, this Article



  



02110900 6



* * *



  



  



THIRTEENTH shall not apply to any director elected by any class (other than

Common Stock) or series which may be or become entitled to elect a director

voting as a separate class or series, and the removal of such a director shall

be governed by the provisions relating to that class or series.



FOURTEENTH: A director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the

Corporation or its shareholders for money damages for any action, or any

failure to take any action, as a director, except for: (a) the amount of a

financial benefit received by a director to which he is not entitled; (b) an

intentional infliction of harm on the Corporation or the shareholders; (c) a

violation of Section 79-4-8.33 of the Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended,

more commonly referred to as Section 8.33 of the Mississippi Business

Corporation Act, as presently in effect or as amended thereafter, pertaining

to liability for unlawful distributions; or (d) an intentional violation of

criminal law. If Mississippi law is hereafter amended to authorize

corporations to take corporate action further limiting or eliminating the

personal liability of directors, then the liability of each director of the

Corporation shall be limited or eliminated to the full extent permitted by

Mississippi law as so amended from time to time. Neither the amendment nor

repeal of this Article, nor the adoption of any provision of these Articles of

Incorporation inconsistent with this Article, shall eliminate or reduce the

effect of this Article in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of

action, suit or claim that, but for this Article, would accrue or arise, prior

to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.



FIFTEENTH: The Corporation may indemnify its directors and officers for

liability (as defined in Section 79-4-8.50(5) of the Mississippi Code of 1972,

as amended) to any person for any action taken, or any failure to take any

action, as a director or officer, as the case may be, except liability for (a)

receipt of a financial benefit to which he is not entitled, (b) an intentional

infliction of harm on the Corporation or its shareholders, (c) violation of

Section 79-4-8.33 of the Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended, or (d) an

intentional violation of criminal law.

EXHIBIT A



CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS



OF



SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK



OF



SANDERSON FARMS, INC.



(Pursuant to Section 79-4-6.02 of the



Mississippi Business Corporation Law)



  



Sanderson Farms, Inc., a Mississippi corporation (the “Corporation”), hereby

certifies that the following resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors

of the Corporation as required by Section 79-4-6.02 of the Business

Corporation Law at a meeting duly called and held on April 21, 1989:



  



RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of

Directors of this Corporation (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”) in

accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of

Directors hereby creates a series of Preferred Stock, par value $100.00 per

share (the “Preferred Stock”), of the Corporation and hereby states the

designation and number of shares, and fixes the preferences, limitations, and

relative rights thereof as follows:



  



Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock:



Section 1. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be

designated as “Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock” (the “Series A

Preferred Stock”) and the number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred

Stock shall be 500,000. Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by

resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that no decrease shall reduce

the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less than the

number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for

issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon

the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation

convertible into Series A Preferred Stock.



Section 2. Dividends and Distributions.



(A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of

Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the

Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of

Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par

value $1.00 per share (the “Common Stock”), of the Corporation, and of any

other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by

the Board of Directors out of funds



  



02110900 8



* * *



  



  



legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the

first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date

being referred to herein as a “Quarterly Dividend Payment Date”), commencing

on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a

share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per

share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1 or (b)

subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the

aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate

per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other

distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a

subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or

otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a

share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any

time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of

Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the

outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by

payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser

number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which

holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior

to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by

multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the

denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A

Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after

it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a

dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no

dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during

the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1 per share on the Series A

Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date.



(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of

Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next

preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such

shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the

date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination

of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a

quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either

of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from

such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not

bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an

amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and

payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis

among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix

a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred

Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared

thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date

fixed for the payment thereof.



  



02110900 9



* * *



  



  



Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock

shall have the following voting rights:



  



(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share

of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on

all matters submitted to a vote for the stockholders of the Corporation. In

the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the

Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or effect a subdivision or

combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of

Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then

in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of

Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall

be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which

is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such

event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock

that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



(B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other Certificate of

Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by

law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of

shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having

general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters

submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.



(C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of

Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent

shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with

holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.



Section 4. Certain Restrictions.



(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable

on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears,

thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions,

whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding

shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:



(i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares

of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;



(ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares

stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total

amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;



(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any

stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution

or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation

may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such

junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking

junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up)

to the Series A Preferred Stock; or



(iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of

Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the

Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in

writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all

holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after

consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative

rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine

in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective

series or classes.



(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to

purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the

Corporation unless the Corporation would, under paragraph (A) of this Section

4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.



Section 5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased

or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be

retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares

shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of

Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock

subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in

the Articles of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of Designations

creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise

required by law.



Section 6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation,

dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made

(1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends

or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred

Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock

shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid

dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of

such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock

shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the

provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the

aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares

of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity

(either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with

the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series

A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts

to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation,

dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time

declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common

Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the

outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by

payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser

number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount

to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled

immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of the

preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction

the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



Section 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter

into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the

shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or

securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share

of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or

changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment

hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock,

securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may

be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or

exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any

dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a

subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of

Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend

in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common

Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence

with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock

shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of

which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after

such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common

Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



Section 8. No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be

redeemable.



Section 9. Rank. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the

payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of

any other class of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock.



Section 10. Amendment. The Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall

not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the

powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to

affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least

two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting

together as a single class.

          par  value  per  share, all of which shares were  denominated  as

          of Common Stock were issued and outstanding.



               SECOND:    All  such  amendments   have   been  effected  in

          conformity with law.



               THIRD:    The  date of incorporation of the Corporation  was

          April  26,  1989 and the  date  of  these  Amended  and  Restated

               FOURTH:    Acting  by  written consent of shareholders dated

          February  8, 1997 pursuant to  Section  76(B)  of  the  Louisiana

          Stock   of   the   Corporation   entitled  to  vote  thereon  and

          constituting more than two-thirds  of  the  shares entitled to be

          amending  the  Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation as in

               FIFTH:    The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation

          of the Corporation are as follows:



                                      ARTICLE I

                                         Name



               The name of the corporation is Gulf Island Fabrication, Inc.



                                      ARTICLE II

                                       Purpose



               The purpose  of  the  Corporation is to engage in any lawful

          activity for which corporations  may be formed under the Business

          Corporation Law of Louisiana.



                                     ARTICLE III

                                       Capital



               A.   Authorized  Stock.   The  Corporation  shall  have  the

          authority to issue an aggregate of 25,000,000  shares  of capital

          stock, of which 20,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock,  no  par

          value  per  share, and 5,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock,

               B.   Preferred  Stock.   Shares  of  Preferred  Stock may be

          issued  from  time  to time in one or more series.  Authority  is

          hereby vested in the  Board  of  Directors  of the Corporation to

          amend these Articles of Incorporation from time  to  time  to fix

          the  preferences, limitations and relative rights as between  the

          Preferred  Stock  and  the Common Stock, and to fix variations in

          the  preferences, limitations  and  relative  rights  as  between

          different series of Preferred Stock.



               C.   Reclassification.  From and after the effective date of

          these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, each issued

          and outstanding share of Common Stock, no par value per share, of

          the Corporation  outstanding  immediately  prior  hereto shall be

          reclassified into three and 5/10 (3.5) shares of Common Stock, no

          par value per share.



                                      ARTICLE IV

                                      Directors



               A.   Number  of  Directors.   The  Board of Directors  shall

          consist  of such number of persons as shall  be  designated  from

          time to time  in  the  by-laws  of the Corporation, or, if not so

          designated, as may be designated  from time to time by resolution

          of  the Board of Directors, provided  that  no  decrease  in  the

          number  of  directors  shall  shorten  the  term of any incumbent

          director.



               B.   Classification.   The  Board of Directors,  other  than

          those who may be elected by the holders of any class or series of

          stock having preference over the Common  Stock as to dividends or

          upon liquidation (whose terms of office may  be determined by the

          Board of Directors pursuant to Article III(B)), shall be divided,

          with  respect to the time during which, they shall  bold  office,

          into three  classes  as  nearly equal in number as possible, with

          the initial term of office  of  the Class I directors expiring at

          the annual meeting of shareholders  to  be  held  in 1998, of the

          Class II directors expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting

          of shareholders, and of the Class III directors expiring  at  the

          second succeeding annual meeting, with all such directors to hold

          office until their successors are elected and qualified.  At each

          subsequent  annual  meeting  of shareholders, directors chosen to

          succeed those whose terms then  expire  shall  be elected to hold

          office for a term expiring at the annual meeting  of shareholders

          held in the third year following the year of their  election  and

          until  their  successors  are duly elected and qualified.  If the

          Board of Directors shall appoint  any  director to fill a vacancy

          on the Board, whether resulting from an increase in the number of

          directors  or otherwise, such Director shall  be  assigned  to  a

          class by the  Board of Directors so that all classes of directors

          shall be as nearly  equal in number as possible.  In the event of

          a decrease in the number of directors, the Board of Directors may

          reassign the remaining  directors  to classes so that all classes

          of directors shall be as nearly equal in number as possible.



               C.   Vacancies.  Except as provided in Article IV(F) hereof,

          any vacancy on the Board (including any vacancy resulting from an

          increase in the authorized number of  directors or from a failure

          of  the  shareholders  to  elect  the full number  of  authorized

          directors) may, notwithstanding any resulting absence of a quorum

          of directors, be filled by a vote of  at  least two-thirds of the

          directors  remaining  in office, provided that  the  shareholders

          shall have the right to  fill  the vacancy at any special meeting

          called for such purpose prior to  any  such  action by the Board.

          Vacancies  on  the Board may be filled only as provided  in  this

          Article IV(C).



               D.   Removal.   Except  as provided in Article IV(F) hereof,

          any one or more directors may  be  removed, at any time, (i) with

          or without cause, by the affirmative  vote of at least two-thirds

          of the directors then constituting the Board of Directors or (ii)

          only for cause, by the holders of not less than two-thirds of the

          Total Voting Power (as defined in Article  VII(C) hereof) that is

          present  or  represented  at  a special meeting  of  shareholders

          called for such purpose, voting  together as a single class.  For

          purposes  of  this  Article  IV(D),  ""cause""  shall  mean  (i)  a

          conviction of a director by a court of  competent jurisdiction of

          a  felony  involving  moral turpitude if such  conviction  is  no

          longer subject to direct  appeal  or  (ii)  an  adjudication by a

          court of competent jurisdiction of liability for gross negligence

          or gross misconduct in the performance of the director's  duty to

          the  Corporation  in  a  matter  of substantial importance to the

          Corporation if such adjudication is  no  longer subject to direct

          appeal.   At  the  same  meeting  in  which  the   directors   or

          shareholders  remove  one  or  more  directors,  a  successor  or

          successors  may be elected for the unexpired term of the director

          or directors removed.  Except as set forth in this Article IV(D),

          or in any provision  of  these Articles of Incorporation relating

          to removal of directors elected  by  holders  of Preferred Stock,

          directors shall not be subject to removal.



               E.   Board Nominations.  Except as provided in Article IV(F)

          hereof,  only  persons who are nominated in accordance  with  the

          procedures set forth  in this Article IV(E) shall be eligible for

          election as directors.   Nominations  of  persons for election to

          the  Board  of  Directors of the Corporation may  be  made  at  a

          meeting of shareholders  by  or  at the direction of the Board of

          Directors  or by any shareholder of  record  of  the  Corporation

          entitled to  vote  at  such meeting for the election of directors

          who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Article

          IV(E).  Such nominations,  other  than  those  made  by or at the

          direction  of  the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant  to

          timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation.  To

          be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed

          and received at  the principal office of the Corporation not less

          than  45  days nor more  than  90  days  prior  to  the  meeting,

          provided, however,  that  in  the  event  that  less than 55 days

          notice or prior public disclosure of the date of  the  meeting is

          given  or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder  to  be

          timely must  be so received at the principal executive offices of

          the Corporation  no later than the close of business on the tenth

          day following the  day  on  which  such notice of the date of the

          meeting  was  mailed or such public disclosure  was  made.   Such

          shareholder's notice shall set forth or include the following:



                    1. as  to  each person whom the shareholder proposes to

               nominate for election  or re-election as a director, (a) the

               name, age, business address  and residential address of such

               person, (b) the principal occupation  or  employment of such

               person, (c) the class and number of shares  of capital stock

               of  the  Corporation of which such person is the  beneficial

               owner (as  defined  in  Rule  13d-3  promulgated  under  the

               Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange

               ""Act"")), (d) such person's written consent to being named in

               the proxy statement as  a nominee and to serve as a director

               if elected and (e) any other  information  relating  to such

               person   that   would   be   required  to  be  disclosed  in

               solicitations of proxies for the  election  of directors, or

               would  be  otherwise  required,  in  each  case pursuant  to

               Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act; and



                    2. as to the shareholder of record giving  the  notice,

               (a)  the  name  and  address of such shareholder and (b) the

               class  and  number  of  shares   of  capital  stock  of  the

               Corporation  of  which such shareholder  is  the  beneficial

               owner  (as defined  in  Rule  13d-3  promulgated  under  the

               Exchange  Act).  If requested in writing by the Secretary of

               the Corporation  at least 15 days in advance of the meeting,

               such shareholder shall disclose to the Secretary, within ten

               days  of such request,  whether  such  person  is  the  sole

               beneficial  owner  of the shares held of record by him, and,

               if not, the name and  address  of each other person known by

               the  shareholder of record to claim  or  have  a  beneficial

               interest in such shares.



          At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by

          the Board of  Directors  for election as a director shall furnish

          to the Secretary of the Corporation  that information required to

          be  set  forth  in  a  shareholders notice  of  nomination  which

          pertains to the nominee.   If a shareholder seeks to nominate one

          or more directors, the Secretary  shall  appoint  two inspectors,

          who  shall  not be affiliated with the Corporation, to  determine

          whether the shareholder has complied with this Article IV(E).  If

          the inspectors  shall  determine  that  the  shareholder  has not

          complied with this Article IV(E), the defective nomination  shall

          be  disregarded  and  the inspectors shall direct the Chairman of

          the meeting to declare  at  the  meeting that such nomination was

          not  made  in accordance with the procedures  prescribed  by  the

          Articles of Incorporation.



               F.   Directors    Elected    by    Preferred   Shareholders.

          Notwithstanding anything in these Articles  of  Incorporation  to

          the  contrary, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or

          series  of  stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to

          dividends or  upon  liquidation  shall  have  the  right,  voting

          separately  as  a  class,  to  elect one or more directors of the

          Corporation, the provisions of these  Articles  of  Incorporation

          (as they may be duly amended from time to time) fixing the rights

          and preferences of such preferred stock shall govern with respect

          to  the nomination, election, term, removal, vacancies  or  other

          related matters with respect to such directors.



                                      ARTICLE V

                                       By-laws



               A.   Adoption,   Amendment   and  Repeal.   By-laws  of  the

          Corporation may be adopted only by  a  majority vote of the Board

          of Directors.   By-laws may be amended or  repealed only by (i) a

          two-thirds  vote  of all directors who constitute  the  Board  of

          Directors, or (ii)  the  affirmative  vote  of  the holders of at

          least eighty percent of that portion of the Total  Voting  Power,

          as defined in Article  VII(C) hereof, voting together as a single

          class,  that  is present or represented at any regular or special

          meeting  of  shareholders,   the   notice  of  which  meeting  of

          shareholders  expressly  states that the  proposed  amendment  or

          repeal is to be considered at the meeting.



               B.   New Matters.  Any  purported  amendment  to the By-laws

          which would add thereto a matter not expressly covered in the By-

          laws  prior  to  such  purported  amendment  shall  be deemed  to

          constitute  the  adoption  of  a  By-law  provision  and  not  an

          amendment to the By-laws.



                                      ARTICLE VI

                             Application of Certain Laws



               The Corporation hereby elects not to be governed by Sections

          132,  133  and  134  of  the  Louisiana  Business Corporation Law

          (La.R.S. 12:132, La.R.S. 12:133 and La.R.S. 12:134).



                                     ARTICLE VII

                       Special Shareholder Voting Requirements



               A.   Amendments.  Unless approved by  vote  of at least two-

          thirds  of  the  directors  constituting the Board of  Directors,

          Articles  IV,  V,  VI,  VII,  VIII  and  X  of  the  Articles  of

          Incorporation may be amended only  by the affirmative vote of not

          less  than  eighty  percent  of the Total  Voting  Power  of  the

          Corporation.



               B.   Other Corporate Actions.   If a vote of shareholders is

          required to authorize an agreement of  merger or consolidation of

          the  Corporation,  the sale of all or substantially  all  of  the

          assets of the Corporation  or  the  voluntary  dissolution of the

          Corporation, then, unless such action has been approved  by  vote

          of at least two-thirds of the directors constituting the Board of

          Directors,  such action may be authorized only by the affirmative

          vote  of  eighty  percent  of  the  Total  Voting  Power  of  the

          Corporation.



               C.   Total  Voting  Power.   The  term  ""Total Voting Power""

          means the total number of votes that shareholders, and holders of

          any bonds, debentures or other obligations granted  voting rights

          by  the  Corporation pursuant to La.R.S. 12:75(H), are  generally

          entitled to cast with respect to the election of directors or, if

          such term  is  used with reference to any other particular matter

          properly brought  before  the  shareholders or such other holders

          for their consideration and vote,  means the total number of such

          votes that are entitled to be cast with respect to such matter.



                                    ARTICLE VIII

                     Limitation of Liability and Indemnification



               A.   Limitation of Liability.  No director or officer of the

          Corporation  shall  be  liable  to  the  Corporation  or  to  its

          shareholders  for monetary damages for breach  of  his  fiduciary

          duty  as a director  or  officer,  provided  that  the  foregoing

          provision  shall  not  eliminate  or  limit  the  liability  of a

          director or officer for (1) any breach of his duty of loyalty  to

          the Corporation or its shareholders; (2) acts or omissions not in

          good  faith  or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing

          violation of law; (3) liability for unlawful distributions of the

          Corporation's  assets  to,  or  redemptions or repurchases of the

          Corporation's shares from shareholders  of the Corporation, under

          and  to  the  extent  provided in La.R.S. 12:92(D);  or  (4)  any

          transaction from which  he  derived an improper personal benefit.

          If, after the date hereof, the Louisiana Business Corporation Law

          is amended to authorize further  elimination  or  limitation  the

          personal  liability  of directors or officers, then the liability

          of  a  director  or  an  officer  of  the  Corporation  shall  be

          eliminated or limited to the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  the

          Louisiana Business Corporation Law, as so amended.



               B.   Indemnification.  Subject to such limitations as may be

          determined  by the Board of Directors (provided that no change in

          such   limitations    may   adversely   affect   any   claim   to

          indemnification  that  arises   prior   to   such   change),  the

          Corporation  shall  indemnify each of its directors to  the  full

          extent from time to time  permitted  by law, and may so indemnify

          each of its officers, against any expenses  or  costs,  including

          attorney's  fees,  actually  or  reasonably  incurred  by  him in

          connection  with  any  threatened,  pending  or  completed  claim

          action,    suit   or   proceeding,   whether   criminal,   civil,

          administrative  or  investigative  against  such  person or as to

          which  he is involved solely as a witness or person  required  to

          give evidence



               C.      Authorization  of  Further  Actions.    The Board of

          Directors  may (1) cause the Corporation to enter into  contracts

          with its directors  and  officers providing for the limitation of

          liability  set  forth  in this  Article  to  the  fullest  extent

          permitted by law, (2) adopt  By-laws or resolutions, or cause the

          Corporation    to   enter   into   contracts,    providing    for

          indemnification  of directors and officers of the Corporation and

          other  persons  (including  but  not  limited  to  directors  and

          officers of the Corporation's  direct  and indirect subsidiaries)

          to  the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  law and  (3)  cause  the

          Corporation to exercise the powers set forth  in  La.R.S. 12:83F,

          notwithstanding that some or all of the members of  the  Board of

          Directors acting with respect to the foregoing may be parties  to

          such contracts or beneficiaries of such By-laws or resolutions or

          the  exercise of such powers.  No repeal or amendment of any such

          By-laws  or  resolutions  limiting  the  right to indemnification

          thereunder  shall  affect  the  entitlement  of   any  person  to

          indemnification   whose   claim   thereto  results  from  conduct

          occurring prior to the date of such repeal or amendment.



               D.   Subsidiaries.  The Board  of  Directors  may  cause the

          Corporation  to  approve for its direct and indirect subsidiaries

          limitation of liability and indemnification provisions comparable

          to the foregoing.



               E.   Amendment.   In addition to any other votes required by

          law or these Articles of  Incorporation  (and notwithstanding the

          fact that a lesser percentage may be specified  by  law  or these

          Articles  of  Incorporation), the affirmative vote of the holders

          of at least 80%  of  the  Total Voting Power shall be required to

          repeal this Article or to amend  this Article so as to reduce the

          limitation  of  liability  set forth  herein  or  the  rights  to

          indemnification or the powers  of the Board of Directors provided

          in this Article, and any amendment  or  repeal  of  this  Article

          shall  not adversely affect any indemnification or limitation  of

          liability  of a director or officer of the Corporation under this

          Article with respect to any action or inaction occurring prior to

          the time of such amendment or repeal.



                                     ARTICLE IX

                                      Reversion



               Cash,  property  or  share  dividends,  shares  issuable  to

          shareholders  in connection with a reclassification of stock, and

          the redemption  price of redeemed shares, that are not claimed by

          the shareholders  entitled  thereto  within  one  year  after the

          dividend or redemption price became payable or the shares  became

          issuable,  despite  reasonable  efforts by the Corporation to pay

          the dividend or redemption price  or deliver the certificates for

          the shares to such shareholders within  such  time,  shall at the

          expiration  of  such  time,  revert  in  full  ownership  to  the

          Corporation,   and  the  Corporation's  obligation  to  pay  such

          dividend or redemption  price  or  issue such shares, as the case

          may be, shall thereupon cease, provided,  however, that the Board

          of Directors may, at any time, for any reason satisfactory to it,

          but need not, authorize (1) payment of the  amount of any cash or

          property  dividend  or redemption price or (2)  issuance  of  any

          shares,  ownership of  which  has  reverted  to  the  Corporation

          pursuant to  this  Article,  to the person or entity who or which

          would be entitled thereto had such reversion not occurred.



                                      ARTICLE X

                          Special Meetings of Shareholders



               A.   Special meetings of  shareholders,  for  any purpose or

          purposes,  may be called in any manner set forth in the  By-laws,

          provided that  the power of shareholders as such to call or cause

          to be called special  meetings  shall  be governed exclusively by

          paragraph B of this Article.



               B.   At  any  time,  upon  the  written   request   of   any

          shareholder  or group of shareholders holding in the aggregate at

          least a majority  of the Total Voting Power, the Secretary of the

          Corporation shall call  a  special  meeting of shareholders to be

          held at the registered office of the  Corporation at such time as

          the Secretary may fix not less than 15  nor  more  than  60  days

          after  the  receipt  of  said request, and if the Secretary shall

          neglect or refuse to fix such  time  or  to  give  notice  of the

          meeting,  the shareholder or shareholders making the request  may

          do so.  Such requests must state the specific purpose or purposes

          of the proposed special meeting, and the business to be conducted

          thereat shall be limited to such purpose or purposes.

![](exhibit31q22019003.jpg)



class of stock herein or hereafter authorized to such persons, and for such

consideration, as the Board of Directors shall from time to time, in its

discretion, determine, whether or not greater consideration could be received

upon the issue or sale of the same number of shares of another class, and as

otherwise permitted by law. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the

Corporation shall have the power to purchase any shares of any class of stock

herein or hereafter authorized from such persons, and for such consideration,

as the Board of Directors shall from time to time, in its discretion,

determine, whether or not less consideration could be paid upon the purchase

of the same number of shares of another class, and as otherwise permitted by

law. FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the

business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further

definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of

its directors and stockholders: (a) The business and affairs of the

Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of

Directors. (b) The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three (3)

nor more than fifteen (15) members, the exact number of which shall be fixed

from time to time exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by the

affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors, and subject

to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock, if any, the exact number

may be increased or decreased (but not to less than three (3) or more than

fifteen (15)). (c) The directors shall, until the annual meeting of

stockholders to be held in 2021, be divided into three classes, designated

Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be

possible, of an equal number of directors. The term of the Class I directors

elected at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders shall terminate on the date

of the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders; the term of the Class II directors

elected at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders shall terminate on the date

of the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders; and the term of the Class III

directors elected at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders shall terminate

on the date of the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders or, in each case, upon

such director’s earlier death, resignation or removal. At each succeeding

annual meeting of stockholders beginning with the 2019 annual meeting of

stockholders, directors standing for election shall be elected annually for

one-year terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders

and until his or her respective successor has been duly elected and qualified.

(d) Except as provided in Paragraph (e) of this Article FIFTH, directors shall

be elected by a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting of

stockholders; provided, however, that, if the number of nominees for director

exceeds the number of directors to be elected, directors shall be elected by a

plurality of the votes cast. A director shall hold office until the annual

meeting of stockholders for the year in which his or her term expires and

until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject,

however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal

from office. Directors need not be stockholders. Elections of directors need

not be by written ballot unless the Corporation’s By-Laws so provide. (e)

Subject to the terms of any one or more classes or series of the Preferred

Stock, any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in

the number of 3



* * *



![](exhibit31q22019004.jpg)



directors or the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal

from office or other cause may be filled by a majority of the Board of

Directors then in office, in their sole discretion, even if less than a

quorum, or by a sole remaining director, in his or her sole discretion. Any

director appointed to fill a vacancy on the Corporation’s Board of Directors

not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same

remaining term as that of his or her predecessor. In no case will a decrease

in the number of directors have the effect of removing or shortening the term

of any incumbent director. Prior to and until the time at which the Board of

Directors ceases to be classified pursuant to Article FIFTH, Section (c), of

this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, except as otherwise required by

applicable law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of

the Preferred Stock then outstanding, any or all of the directors of the

Corporation may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and

only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the

shares of voting common stock. From and after the time at which the Board of

Directors ceases to be classified pursuant to Article FIFTH, Section (c),

except as otherwise required by applicable law and subject to the rights, if

any, of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any or all

of the directors of the Corporation may be removed from office at any time,

with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a

majority of shares of voting common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of the Preferred

Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by

class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of

stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other

features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation and the resolution or resolutions adopted by the

Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such class or series. (f) In

addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by statute expressly

conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such

powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the

Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this

Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and any By-Laws adopted by the

stockholders; provided, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the

stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have

been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted. SIXTH: No director shall be

personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary

damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such

exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL

as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If the DGCL is amended

hereafter to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability

of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be

eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so

amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article SIXTH shall not adversely

affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at

the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions

occurring prior to such repeal or modification. SEVENTH: The Corporation shall

indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or

permitted by law, as now or hereafter in effect, and such right to

indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director

or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of his or her

heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives; provided, however,

that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to 4



* * *



![](exhibit31q22019005.jpg)



indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any

director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal

representatives) in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated

by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or

consented to by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred

by this Article SEVENTH shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation

the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any

proceeding in advance of its final disposition, subject to receipt of an

undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount

if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be

indemnified by the Corporation. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized

from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification

and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation,

or to those persons serving at the Corporation’s request as a director,

officer, employee or agent of, or in a fiduciary capacity with respect to,

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,

similar to those conferred in this Article SEVENTH to directors and officers

of the Corporation. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on

behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation,

or is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation serving at the

request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of, or in

a fiduciary capacity with respect to, another corporation, partnership, joint

venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such

person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of

such person’s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the

power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under

the provisions of this Article SEVENTH. The rights to indemnification and to

the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article SEVENTH shall not be

exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire

under this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws of the

Corporation, any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested

directors or otherwise. Any repeal or modification of any provision of this

Article SEVENTH shall not adversely affect any rights to indemnification and

to the advancement of expenses of a director or officer of the Corporation

existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any acts

or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification. EIGHTH: Except as

otherwise expressly provided by the terms of any series of Preferred Stock

permitting the holders of such series of Preferred Stock to act by written

consent, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of

the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of

stockholders of the Corporation, and the ability of the stockholders to

consent in writing to the taking of any action is hereby specifically denied.

NINTH: Unless otherwise required by law or the terms of any resolution or

resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of a

class or series of the Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders, for

any purpose or purposes, may be called by either (i) the Chairman of the Board

of Directors or (ii) the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, 5

hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Amended and Restated

Certificate of Incorporation, provision of the Bylaws of the Corporation,

be paid or set apart before any dividend shall be set apart or paid on the

Common Stock. The dividend payment dates for all series of Preferred Stock

before any amount shall be paid to the holders of the Common Stock. If the

assets of the Corporation distributable upon any such liquidation or

the payments to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the full amounts above

provided for, including an amount equivalent to all unpaid accumulated

dividends as aforesaid, the said assets shall be allocated to the respective

series of Preferred Stock in the ratios that such aggregate liquidation value

of the issued shares of each series bears to the aggregate liquidation value

of the issued shares of all series of Preferred Stock as fixed for the

respective series of Preferred Stock in the Certificate of Incorporation or in

the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the

issuance of the respective series, and shall be distributed among the holders

of the respective series of Preferred Stock according to their respective

shares.



VII. The Preferred Stock of any series shall be subject to redemption at any

time in whole or in part at the amount fixed herein, or fixed by the Board of

Directors as herein provided, for the redemption of such series including an

the stock to be redeemed at their addresses as the same shall appear on the

stock transfer records of the Corporation in such manner as the Board of

Directors shall determine.



VIII. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have no voting power on any

questions whatsoever except as otherwise provided by law, and except that in

the event that the Corporation shall fail to pay any dividend on the Preferred

Stock when it regularly



* * *



becomes due and such default shall continue for the period of six (6) months,

then until but not after such time as accumulated and unpaid dividends on all

outstanding Preferred Stock of all series shall have been paid, the holders of

the outstanding Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive right, voting

separately and as a class, to elect two directors or, if the total number of

directors of the Corporation be only three, then only one director, at each

meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation held for the purpose of

electing directors. At all meetings of stockholders held for the purpose of

electing directors at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall have the

exclusive right, voting separately and as a class, to elect any directors as

order that the balance of directors in such classes shall conform thereto.

Common Stock shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of

votes which, except for this provision as to cumulative voting, he would be

entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his shares of

Common Stock, multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and he may

cast all of such votes for a single nominee for director or may distribute them

among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them as he sees fit.

business, and if at any meeting of the Board of Directors there shall be less

the liability of the directors, then the liability of a director shall be

eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended General

Corporation Law. In addition to the limitation on personal liability of

directors provided herein, the Corporation shall, to the fullest extent

permitted by the General Corporation Law: (x) indemnify its officers and

directors and (y) advance expenses incurred by such officers or directors in

relation to any action, suit or proceeding. Any repeal or modification of this

paragraph by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be prospective only, and

shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability or right to

indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder existing at the time of

such repeal or modification.



                                   ARTICLE IX



                            Meetings Of Stockholders



            A. Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State

of Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be

kept (subject to any provision



                                       5

contained in the statutes) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places

as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the

By-Laws of the Corporation. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot

unless the By-Laws of the Corporation shall so provide.



            B. Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the

Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the

Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable

jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary

way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the

application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the

provisions of Section 291 of the General Corporation Law or on the application

of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the

Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of the General Corporation Law

order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the

stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to

be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number

representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors,

and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the

case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of

the Corporation as consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said

compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by

the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the

creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of

stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the

Corporation.



                                    ARTICLE X



                               Further Amendments



            Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation reserves the right

at any time, and from time to time, to amend, alter, repeal, or rescind any

provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or

hereafter prescribed by law, and other provisions authorized by the laws of the

State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in the manner

now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges

of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors, or any other

persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its

                                   ARTICLE XI



                                Classified Board



            A. Except as may otherwise be provided pursuant to Article IV hereof

with respect to any rights of holders of Preferred Stock to elect additional

directors, the number of directors of the Corporation shall be not less than one

(1) nor more than fifteen (15), with the then-authorized number of directors

being fixed from time to time by or pursuant to a resolution passed by the Board

of Directors of the Corporation.



            B. The directors of the Corporation (other than any directors who

may be elected by holders of Preferred Stock as provided for pursuant to Article

IV hereof) shall be and are divided into three classes: Class I, Class II and

Class III. The number of directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as the

then-authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors permits.

Each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual

meeting of stockholders (an ""Annual Meeting"") following the Annual Meeting at

which such director was elected; provided, however, that each initial director

in Class I shall serve for a term ending on the date of the Annual Meeting held

in 1992, each initial director in Class II shall serve for a term ending on the

date of the Annual Meeting held in 1993, and each initial director in Class III

shall serve for a term ending on the date of the Annual Meeting held in 1994.

Any director who may be elected by holders of Preferred Stock as provided for

pursuant to Article IV hereof shall serve for a term ending on the date of the

next Annual Meeting following the Annual Meeting at which such director was

elected.



            C. In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number

of directors:



                  1. Each director then serving shall nevertheless continue as a

      director of the class of which he is a member until the expiration of his

      term or his prior death, retirement, resignation or removal; and



                  2. Except to the extent that an increase or decrease in the

      authorized number of directors occurs in connection with the rights of

      holders of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors, the newly

      created or eliminated directorships resulting from any increase or

      decrease shall be apportioned by the Board of Directors among the three

      classes so as to keep the number of directors in each class as nearly

      equal as possible.



            D. Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs B and C of this

Article XI. each director shall serve until his successor is elected and

qualified or until his death, retirement, resignation or removal. Except as may

otherwise be



                                       7

<PAGE>



provided pursuant to Article IV hereof with respect to any rights of holders of

Preferred Stock, no director may be removed during his term except for cause.



            E. Except as may otherwise be provided pursuant to Article IV hereof

with respect to any rights of holders of Preferred Stock to elect additional

directors, should a vacancy in the Board of Directors occur or be created

(whether arising through death, retirement, resignation or removal or through an

increase in the number of authorized directors), such vacancy shall be filled by

the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less

than a quorum of the Board of Directors. A director so elected to fill a vacancy

shall serve for the remainder of the term of the class to which he was elected.



            F. During any period when the holders of any series of Preferred

Stock have the right to elect additional directors as provided for or fixed

pursuant to the provisions of Article IV of this Certificate of Incorporation,

then upon commencement and for the duration of the period during which such

right continues (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of

the Corporation shall automatically be increased by such specified number of

directors, and the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect

the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to said provisions,

and (ii) each such additional director shall serve until such director's

successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such director's

right to hold such office terminates pursuant to said provisions, whichever

occurs earlier, subject to his earlier death, disqualification, resignation or

removal. Except as otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the

resolution or resolutions establishing such series, whenever the holders of any

series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are

divested of such right pursuant to the provisions of such stock, the terms of

office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such stock, or

elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation,

disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith

terminate and the total and authorized number of directors of the Corporation

shall be reduced accordingly.



                                   ARTICLE XII



                  Certain Limitations On Powers Of Stockholders



            A. Action shall be taken by the stockholders only at annual or

special meetings of stockholders and stockholders may not act by written

consent.



            B. Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any

purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, or by a

majority of the members of the



                                       8

<PAGE>



Board of Directors, or by a committee of the Board of Directors which has been

duly designated by the Board of Directors and whose powers and authority, as

provided in a resolution of the Board of Directors or in the By-Laws of the

Corporation, include the power to call such meetings. Special meetings of

stockholders of the Corporation may not be called by any other person or

persons.



                                  ARTICLE XIII



                         Vote Required To Amend Articles



            The provisions set forth in this Article XIII and in Article XI

(provisions as to number and classes of directors), and Article XII (provisions

regarding certain limitations on powers of stockholders) may not be repealed or

amended in any respect, and no provision imposing cumulative voting in the

election of directors may be added, unless such action is approved by the

affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of all of the outstanding

shares of capital stock of the Corporation or another corporation entitled to

vote generally in the election of directors.



                                    ARTICLE XIV



                                Executive Committee



            The Board of Directors, pursuant to the By-Laws of the Corporation

or by resolution passed by a majority of the then- authorized number of

directors, may designate any of their number to constitute an Executive

Committee, which Executive Committee, to the fullest extent permitted by law and

provided for in said resolution or in the By-Laws of the Corporation, shall have

and may exercise all of the powers of the Board of Directors in the management

of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and shall have power to

authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers that may

require it.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY



ARTICLE I



The name of this corporation shall be Weyerhaeuser Company.



ARTICLE II



The purposes for which this corporation is organized are:



1\. To engage in any form of mining, manufacturing, mercantile, financial,

transportation, real estate, recreation or service enterprise not contrary to

law.



2\. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to engage in:



(a) The construction, maintenance and operation of logging roads, chutes,

flumes, and artificial watercourses or waterways and other ways for the

transportation of logs and other timber products;



(b) Catching, booming, sorting, rafting and holding logs, lumber or other

timber products;

ARTICLE III



1\. The aggregate number of shares which this corporation is authorized to

issue shall be 447,000,000, consisting of 7,000,000 preferred shares having a

par value of $1.00 per share, 40,000,000 preference shares having a par value

of $1.00 per share, and 400,000,000 common shares having a par value of $1.25

per share. Shares redeemed, purchased or otherwise reacquired, or surrendered

to the corporation on conversion, shall have the status of authorized and

unissued shares of the class of which they were a part when initially issued

and may be reissued as part of the same or a different series of the same

class of which they were a part when initially issued; unless, as part of the

action of the Board of Directors taken to create any series, the Board of

Directors restricts the right of reissuance, in which case such restricted

right will be operative. Each two common shares having a par value of $1.875

per share heretofore authorized and issued is hereby changed into three common

shares having a par value of $1.25 per share.



2\. The Board of Directors is expressly vested with authority to divide the

preferred shares and the preference shares into series, each of which shall be

so designated as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all

other series and classes. All preferred shares shall be identical and all

preference shares shall be identical, except in each case as to the following

relative rights and preferences, as to which the Board of Directors may fix

and determine variations among the different series of each class:



* * *



#####  



(a) The rate of dividend;



(b) Whether shares may be redeemed and, if so, the redemption price and the

terms and conditions of redemption;



(c) The amount payable upon shares in the event of voluntary and involuntary

liquidation, provided that the aggregate amount so payable with respect to all

series of preferred shares shall not exceed $350,000,000;



(d) Sinking fund provisions, if any, for the redemption or purchase of shares;



(e) The terms and conditions, if any, on which shares may be converted;



(f) If permitted by the laws of the State of Washington, voting rights, if

any.



3\. The preferences, limitations and relative rights of the preferred shares

of each series, the preference shares of each series and the common shares are

as follows:



(a) Out of the funds of the corporation legally available for payment of

dividends, the holders of the preferred shares of each series and the

preference shares of each series shall be entitled to receive, when and as

declared by the Board of Directors, cumulative dividends at the rate

determined by the Board of Directors for such series, and no more. Dividends

on the preferred shares and the preference shares shall accrue on a daily

basis from such date as may be fixed by the Board of Directors for any series.

Unless dividends at the rate prescribed for each series of preferred shares

shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment in full on all

outstanding preferred shares for all past dividend periods and the current

dividend period, no dividends shall be declared or paid upon any class of

shares ranking as to dividends subordinate to the preferred shares, and no sum

or sums shall be set aside for the redemption of preferred shares of any

series (including any sinking fund payment therefor) or for the purchase,

redemption (including any sinking fund payment therefor) or other acquisition

for value of any class or series of shares ranking as to dividends or assets

on a parity with or subordinate to any such series of preferred shares. Unless

dividends at the rate prescribed for each series of preference shares shall

have been declared and paid or set apart for payment in full on all

outstanding preference shares for all past dividend periods and the current

dividend period, no dividends shall be declared or paid upon any class of

shares ranking as to dividends subordinate to the preference shares, and no

sum or sums shall be set aside for the redemption of preference shares of any

series (including any sinking fund payment therefor) or for the purchase,

redemption (including any sinking fund payment therefor) or other acquisition

for value of any class or series of shares ranking as to dividends or assets

on a parity with or subordinate to any such series of preference shares.

Accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares and on the preference

shares shall not bear interest.



(b) Out of any funds of the corporation legally available for dividends and

remaining after full cumulative dividends upon all series of preferred shares

and preference shares then outstanding shall have been paid or set apart for

payment for all past dividend periods and the current dividend period, then,

and not otherwise, the Board of Directors may declare and pay or set apart for

payment dividends on the common shares, and the holders of preferred shares

and preference shares shall not be entitled to share therein.



(c) In the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation of the corporation,

before any distribution of the assets shall be made to the holders of any

class of shares ranking as to assets subordinate to the preferred shares, the

holders of the preferred shares of each series shall be entitled to receive

out of the assets of the corporation available for distribution to its

shareholders the sum of (i) the amount per share



* * *



#####  



determined by the Board of Directors as provided in paragraph 2(c) of this

Article III, and (ii) the amount per share equal to all accrued and unpaid

dividends thereon, such sum constituting the preferential amount for the

preferred shares. If, in the event of such liquidation, the assets of the

corporation available for distribution to its shareholders shall be

insufficient to permit full payment to the holders of the preferred shares of

each series of their respective preferential amounts, then such assets shall

be distributed ratably among such holders in proportion to their respective

preferential amounts. In the event of such liquidation, subject to such right

of the holders of the preferred shares of each series, but before any

distribution of the assets shall be made to the holders of any class of shares

ranking as to assets subordinate to the preference shares, the holders of the

preference shares of each series shall be entitled to receive out of the

assets of the corporation available for distribution to its shareholders the

sum of (i) the amount per share determined by the Board of Directors as

provided in paragraph 2(c) of this Article III, and (ii) the amount per share

equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, such sum constituting the

preferential amount for the preference shares. If, in the event of such

liquidation, after full payment of the preferential amounts of the preferred

shares of each series, the assets of the corporation available for

distribution to its shareholders shall be insufficient to permit full payment

to the holders of the preference shares of each series of their respective

preferential amounts, then such assets shall be distributed ratably among such

holders in proportion to their respective preferential amounts. If, in the

event of such liquidation, the holders of the preferred shares of each series

and the preference shares of each series shall have received full payment of

their respective preferential amounts, the holders of the common shares shall

be entitled, to the exclusion of the holders of the preferred shares of each

series and the preference shares of each series, to share ratably in all

remaining assets of the corporation available for distribution to

shareholders. Neither the consolidation nor merger of the corporation with or

into any other corporation or corporations, the sale or lease of all or

substantially all of the assets of the corporation, nor the merger or

consolidation of any other corporation into and with the corporation, shall be

deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary liquidation.



(d) Each outstanding preferred share shall be entitled to one vote, not as a

class, on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, and

the holders of preference shares shall have no voting rights except as

provided in this Article III, provided, however, that if the Board of

Directors is permitted by law to vary voting rights as between series of a

class, and does in fact do so, then the voting rights of any series of either

class shall be those determined by the Board of Directors under paragraph 2(f)

of this Article III. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) as long as any

preferred shares shall be outstanding, the corporation will not, without the

affirmative vote or consent in writing of at least two-thirds of the

outstanding preferred shares, amend these Articles of Incorporation for the

purpose of, or take any other action to, (A) increase the aggregate number of

preferred shares or shares of any other class ranking as to dividends or

assets on a parity with or prior to the preferred shares, (B) change the

designations, preferences, limitations, voting or other relative rights of the

preferred shares or of any outstanding series of preferred shares, (C) effect

an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part of the preferred

shares, (D) change the preferred shares into the same or a different number of

shares, with or without par value of the same or any other class, or (E)

cancel or otherwise affect dividends on the shares of any series of preferred

shares which have accrued but have not been declared, and (ii) as long as any

preference shares shall be outstanding, the corporation will not, without the

affirmative vote or consent in writing of at least two-thirds of the

outstanding preference shares, amend these Articles of Incorporation for the

purpose of, or take any other action to, (A) increase the aggregate number of

preferred or preference shares or shares of any other class ranking as to

dividends or assets on a parity with or prior to the preference shares, (B)

change the designations, preferences, limitations, voting or other relevant

rights of the preference shares or of any outstanding series of preference

shares, (C) effect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or

part of the preference shares, (D) change the preference shares into the same

or a different number of shares, with or without par value, of the same or

another class, or (E) cancel or otherwise affect dividends on the shares of

any series of preference shares which have accrued but have not been declared.



* * *



#####  



(e) Whenever dividends on the preferred shares shall be in arrears in an

aggregate amount equal to at least six quarterly dividends thereon, whether or

not consecutive, then the holders of the preferred shares, voting as a class,

shall be exclusively entitled to elect two additional directors beyond the

number specified in the bylaws to be elected from time to time by all

shareholders and beyond the number specified in this paragraph (e) to be

elected by holders of the preference shares. Whenever dividends on the

preference shares shall be in arrears in an aggregate amount equal to at least

six quarterly dividends thereon, whether or not consecutive, then the holders

of the preference shares, voting as a class, shall be exclusively entitled to

elect two additional directors beyond the number specified in the bylaws to be

elected from time to time by all shareholders and beyond the number specified

in this paragraph (e) to be elected by holders of the preferred shares.



(f) At any time when the holders of a class of shares become entitled as a

class to elect additional directors pursuant to paragraph 3(e) of this Article

III (the special voting rights), the maximum authorized number of members of

the Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by the number of such

directors specified in such paragraph 3(e) and the vacancies so created shall

be filled only by vote of the holders of such class as hereinafter set forth.

Whenever the special voting rights of a class shall have vested, such rights

may be exercised initially either at a special meeting of the holders of such

class called as hereinafter provided or at any annual meeting of shareholders

held for the purpose of electing directors, and thereafter at such annual

meetings. If, at the time of the vesting of the special voting rights of a

class, the date fixed for the next annual meeting of shareholders is not

within 90 days of such time, the president of the corporation shall call a

special meeting of the holders of such class. Such special meeting shall be

held at the earliest practicable date upon the notice required and at the

place designated for annual meetings of shareholders. If such special meeting

shall not be called by the president within 20 days after the special voting

rights of such class shall have vested, holders of not less than one-tenth of

the shares of such class entitled to vote at such special meeting may call

such special meeting at the expense of the corporation. Any holder of shares

of a class, the special voting rights for which shall have vested, shall have

access to the appropriate share ledger of the corporation for the purpose of

causing such special meeting to be so called. At any annual meeting of

shareholders or at any special meeting at which the holders of a class of

shares shall have special voting rights, 20% of the shares of such class

entitled to special voting rights, represented in person or by proxy, shall

constitute a quorum for such class. At any such meeting or adjournment

thereof, (i) the absence of a quorum of a class of shares having special

voting rights shall not prevent the election of directors, if any, to be

elected pursuant to other special voting rights or pursuant to other than

special voting rights, and the absence of a quorum of shares for the election

of directors pursuant to other than special voting rights shall not prevent

the election of directors pursuant to special voting rights, and (ii) in the

absence of one or more of such quorums, a majority of the holders, represented

in person or by proxy, of each class of shares which lacks a quorum shall have

power to adjourn the meeting for the election of directors which they are

entitled to elect, from time to time, without notice other than announcement

at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. If the office of any director

elected pursuant to the special voting rights of a class becomes vacant by

reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from

office, or otherwise, the remaining director or directors elected pursuant to

the special voting rights of such class shall choose a successor who shall

hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.

The special voting rights of a class shall continue until all arrears in

payment of quarterly dividends on such class shall have been paid and the

dividends thereon for the current quarter shall have been declared and paid or

set apart for payment. Upon any termination of the special voting rights of a

class, the term of office of the directors then in office elected pursuant

thereto shall terminate immediately and the maximum authorized number of

members of the Board of Directors shall automatically be reduced accordingly.



(g) Subject to any applicable provision of law or this Article III, the

corporation shall have the right to purchase, or otherwise reacquire, at

public or private sale or otherwise any shares of any class, except that no

preferred shares shall be purchased unless dividends on all preferred shares

have been



* * *



#####  



declared and paid or set apart for payment in full for all past dividend

periods and no preference shares shall be purchased unless dividends on all

preference shares have been declared and paid or set apart for payment in full

for all past dividend periods.

shares of this corporation, whether now or hereafter authorized, without first

offering such shares to the shareholders of this corporation.

The time of the existence of this corporation shall be perpetual.



ARTICLE V

direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not fewer than nine (9) nor

more than thirteen (13) directors, the exact number to be fixed from time to

time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire

Board of Directors. Whenever used in these Articles of Incorporation, the

phrase entire Board of Directors shall mean that number of directors fixed

by the most recent resolution adopted pursuant to the preceding sentence prior

to the date as of which a determination of the number of directors then

constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be relevant for any purpose

under these Articles of Incorporation. The directors shall be classified, with

respect to the term for which they severally hold office, into three classes,

each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible, one class to hold

office initially for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders to

be held in 1986, another class to hold office initially for a term expiring at

the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 1987, and another class to

hold office initially for a term expiring at the annual meeting of

shareholders to be held in 1988, with the members of each class to hold office

until their successors are elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of

shareholders of the corporation, the successors to the class of directors

whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term

expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders. held in the third year

following the year of their election.



2\. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors and any newly created

directorship resulting from any increase in the number of directors shall be

filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors

then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. No

decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall

shorten the term of any incumbent director.



3\. Any director may be removed from office with cause only by the affirmative

vote of the holders of a majority of the voting capital stock and may be

removed from office without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders

of 67% of the voting capital stock or, in either case, such other percentage

as may be required by applicable law; provided, however, that if applicable

law permits to be required a higher percentage of the votes of the holders of

the voting capital stock to approve any such removal, then the directors may

be removed, with or without cause, as the case may be, only by the affirmative

vote of the holders of the lesser of (i) 80% of the voting capital stock and

(ii) the maximum percentage of such voting capital stock permitted to be

required for such approval.



4\. Advance notice of nominations for the election of directors, other than by

the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, shall be given within the time

and in the manner provided in the bylaws.



* * *



#####  



5\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more

classes or series of preferred or preference shares or of any other class or

series of shares issued by the corporation shall have the right, voting

separately by class or series, to elect directors under specified

circumstances, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other

features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of these

Articles of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected

shall not be classified pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided

by such terms.



ARTICLE VI



In all elections for directors, every shareholder shall have the right to vote

in person or by proxy the number of shares of stock held by him for as many

persons as there are directors to be elected. No cumulative voting for

directors shall be permitted.



ARTICLE VII



1\. Bylaws may be adopted, altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws enacted

by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors (if

notice thereof is contained in the notice of the meeting at which such vote is

taken or if all directors are present) or at any regular meeting of the

shareholders (or at any special meeting thereof duly called for that purpose)

by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and entitled

to vote at such meeting (if notice thereof is contained in the notice of such

meeting).



2\. Nothwithstanding anything contained in paragraph 1 of this Article VII to

the contrary, either (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80%

of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all shares of the

corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting

together as a single class, or (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of the

entire Board of Directors with the concurring vote of a majority of the

Continuing Directors, voting separately and as a subclass of directors, shall

be required to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent

with, Sections 1 and 2 of Article II, Section 1 of Article III, Article XII

and Section 2 of Article XIII of the bylaws. For purposes of this Article VII

and Article VIII, the term Continuing Director shall mean any member of the

Board of Directors who was a member of the Board of Directors on August 13,

1985 or who is elected to the Board of Directors after August 13, 1985 upon

the recommendation of a majority of the Continuing Directors, voting

separately and as a subclass of directors on such recommendation.



ARTICLE VIII

(except as hereinafter provided) or the bylaws of the corporation, the

affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors and the

affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be

cast by the holders of all shares of the corporation entitled to vote

generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,

shall be required to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any provision

inconsistent with, Articles V, VI, VIII and IX and paragraph 2 of Article VII

of these Articles of Incorporation or any provision of such Articles;

provided, however, that the affirmative vote of the holders of 66-2/3% of the

votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all shares entitled to vote

generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,

shall be sufficient to approve any alteration, amendment or repeal of, or

adoption of any provision inconsistent with, Articles V, VI, VIII and IX and

paragraph 2 of Article VII of these Articles of Incorporation that is approved

by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors with

the concurring vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors, voting

separately and as a subclass of directors.

resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board

of Directors.

(i) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by such person or

any of its Affiliates or Associates;



(ii) which such person or any of its Affiliates or Associates has (x) the

right to acquire (whether or not such right is exercisable immediately)

pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise

of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise, or

(y) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding;

or



(iii) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other

person with which such person or any of its Affiliates or Associates has any

agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding,

voting or disposing of any shares of Voting Stock.



(i) For the purposes of determining whether a person is an Interested

Shareholder pursuant to paragraph 3 (e) of this Article X, the number of

shares of Voting Stock deemed to be outstanding shall include shares deemed

owned by an Interested Shareholder through application of paragraph 3 (h) of

this Article X but shall not include any other shares of Voting Stock which

may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or

upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options,

or otherwise.



4\. For the purposes of this Article X, the Continuing Directors shall have

the power and duty to determine, by majority vote, on the basis of information

known to them after reasonable inquiry, whether any transaction specified in

paragraphs 1 (a) (ii) and 1 (a) (iv) meets the monetary tests set forth

therein.



5\. The provisions of this Article X shall not be construed to impose any

fiduciary duty, obligation or responsibility on the Board of Directors, or any

member thereof, to approve such Business



* * *



#####  



Transaction or recommend its adoption or approval to the shareholders, nor

shall any provision of this Article X be construed as limiting, prohibiting or

otherwise restricting in any manner the Board of Directors, or any member

thereof, with respect to evaluations of or actions and responses taken with

respect to such Business Transaction.



6\. No action taken by, or omission of, a Continuing Director in the exercise

(or non-exercise) of the authority and discharge of the responsibilities

conferred or imposed upon Continuing Directors by this Article X shall be

deemed to be, or involve, a breach of the fiduciary duty of such Continuing

Director to the shareholders of the corporation unless it can be demonstrated

by the person asserting such breach that the Continuing Director acted (or

failed to act) in bad faith and in a manner inconsistent with the provisions

and spirit of this Article X.



7\. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, these Articles of

Incorporation (except as hereinafter provided) or the bylaws of the

corporation, the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of

Directors and the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the votes

entitled to be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock,

voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or

repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article X or any

provision hereof; provided, however, that the affirmative vote of the holders

of 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a

single class, shall be sufficient to approve any alteration, amendment or

repeal of, or adoption of any provision inconsistent with, this Article X or

any provision hereof that is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of

the entire Board of Directors with the concurring vote of a majority of the

Continuing Directors, voting separately and as a subclass of directors. The

phrase entire Board of Directors shall mean that number of directors fixed

by the most recent resolution adopted by the Board of Directors prior to the

them by this Article X (or incurred by reason or as a consequence of the

exercise of such authority or the discharge of such responsibilities,

including, without limitation, all attorneys fees and disbursements incurred

in asserting or defending any claim arising out of such exercise) shall be

paid by the corporation. The provisions of this paragraph 8 of this Article X

shall be deemed to be a contract between the corporation and the Continuing

Directors, and it shall be the duty of the Chief Financial Officer of the

corporation to make prompt payment thereof on the written request of a

majority of the Continuing Directors, accompanied by appropriate vouchers and

invoices. The rights conferred upon the Continuing Directors, and the

obligations imposed upon the corporation, by this paragraph 8 of this Article

X shall be in addition to the rights of the Continuing Directors, as

directors, to indemnification under the bylaws of the corporation; provided,

however, that the corporation shall not, by reason of this sentence, be

obliged to make duplicate payments of any item of expense incurred by a

Continuing Director.



ARTICLE XI

limitation or elimination of liability of directors, a director of this

corporation shall not be personally liable to this corporation or its

shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a director, provided that,

except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, this provision shall not

eliminate or limit liability of the director (i) for acts or omissions that

involve intentional misconduct by the director or a knowing violation of law

by the director, (ii) for conduct violating Section 23A.08.450 of the

Washington Business Corporation Act, or (iii) for any transaction from which

director of this corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest

extent permitted by the Washington Business Corporation Act, as so amended.

                        AMERICAN STANDARD COMPANIES INC.



     American  Standard  Companies  Inc., a  corporation  organized and existing

under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby certifies as follows:



     1. The  Corporation  was  incorporated  as ASI Holding  Corporation and its

the State of Delaware on March 15, 1988.



     2. On April 4, 1990, the Board of Directors of the Corporation  unanimously

adopted a resolution authorizing the amendment of the Corporation's  Certificate

of Incorporation  in accordance with Section 242 of the General  Corporation Law

of the State of Delaware.  The  amendment  increased  the  authorized  number of

shares of the  Corporation's  common stock. In lieu of a meeting and vote of the

stockholders of the Corporation, the Corporation's majority stockholder, by less

than unanimous  written consent dated April 13, 1990,  approved the amendment of

the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  and the taking of the actions  contemplated

thereby,  and such  consent  was filed with the  minutes of the  proceedings  of

stockholders  of the  Corporation.  Notice  of  such  action  was  given  to all

stockholders  who did  not  consent  in  writing,  all in  accordance  with  the

provisions  of  Section  228 of the  General  Corporation  Law of the  State  of

Delaware.  The Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of

the State of Delaware on April 19, 1990.

     3. At a meeting  duly held on December 5, 1991,  the Board of  Directors of

the  Corporation   adopted  a  resolution   authorizing  the  amendment  of  the

Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation in accordance with Section 242 of the

General  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  The amendment  decreased the

authorized  number of shares of the  Corporation's  common  stock.  In lieu of a

majority  stockholder,  by less than unanimous written consent dated December 6,

1991,  approved the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation and the taking

of the actions contemplated thereby, and such consent was filed with the minutes

of the proceedings of stockholders of the Corporation. Notice of such action was

given to all stockholders who did not consent in writing, all in accordance with

the  provisions  of Section 228 of the General  Corporation  Law of the State of

Delaware.  The Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of

the State of Delaware on December 20,  1991. A  Certificate  of  Correction  was

filed with the  Secretary  of State of the State of Delaware on January 3, 1992,

indicating the Certificate of Amendment had incorrectly stated that the adoption

of the  resolution  had  been by  unanimous  written  consent  of the  Board  of

Directors of the Corporation.

the  Corporation   adopted  a  resolution   authorizing  the  amendment  of  the

Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation in accordance with Section 242 of the

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The amendment changed the name

of the  Corporation  and required or  permitted  indemnification  of  Directors,

officers,  employees  and agents in  accordance  with Delaware law. In lieu of a

meeting  and vote of the  stockholders  of the  Corporation,  the  Corporation's

majority  stockholder,  by less than unanimous written consent dated November 2,

1994,  approved the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation and the taking

of the actions contemplated thereby, and such consent was filed with the minutes

of the proceedings of stockholders of the Corporation. Notice of such action was

given to all stockholders who did not consent in writing, all in accordance with

the  provisions  of Section 228 of the General  Corporation  Law of the State of

Delaware.  The Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of

the State of Delaware on November 9, 1994.

issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock of the Corporation, having

such terms as the Board of  Directors  may  determine,  and  provided  for other

matters  relating to such common stock and preferred stock. In lieu of a meeting

and vote of the  stockholders of the  Corporation,  the  Corporation's  majority

stockholder,  by less than  unanimous  written  consent dated  December 1, 1994,

approved the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation and the taking of the

actions contemplated thereby, and such consent was filed with the minutes of the

proceedings of stockholders of the Corporation.  Notice of such action was given

to all stockholders  who did not consent in writing,  all in accordance with the

provisions  of  Section  228 of the  General  Corporation  Law of the  State  of

Delaware.  The Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of

the State of Delaware on December 5, 1994.



     6. At a meeting duly held on January 4, 1995, the Board of Directors of the

Corporation  adopted a resolution  authorizing  the amendment and restatement of

the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation as set forth herein in accordance

the  Corporation's  Certificate of  Incorporation  and the taking of the actions

contemplated  thereby,  and such  consent  was  filed  with the  minutes  of the

proceedings of stockholders of the Corporation.  Notice of such action was given

provisions  of  Section  228 of the  General  Corporation  Law of the  State  of

Delaware.  The Restated  Certificate of Incorporation so approved was filed with

the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 24, 1995.



     7. At a meeting  duly held on March 5, 1998,  the Board of Directors of the

Corporation  adopted a resolution  authorizing  the amendment and restatement of

the Corporation's  Restated  Certificate of Incorporation as set forth herein in

accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Sections  242  and  245  of  the  General

Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders

of the Corporation,  held on May 7, 1998, by the vote of more than a majority of

the shares of the  Corporation's  outstanding  common stock,  the  Corporation's

stockholders  approved  the  amendment  and  restatement  of  the  Corporation's

Restated Certificate of Incorporation as set forth herein.

State of  Delaware,  this  Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  amends  and

          FIFTH:  The Board of  Directors  is hereby  authorized  to create  and

     rights  entitling  the  holders  thereof to purchase  from the  Corporation

     shares  of  stock or  other  securities  of the  Corporation  or any  other

     corporation. The times at which and the terms upon which such rights are to

     be issued will be determined by the Board of Directors and set forth in the

     contracts or  instruments  that evidence such rights.  The authority of the

          (c)  Provisions  which  adjust  the number or  exercise  price of such

     rights,  or amount or nature of the stock or other  securities  or property

     receivable  upon  exercise of such rights,  in the event of a  combination,

     split or  recapitalization  of any  stock of the  Corporation,  a change in

     ownership of the  Corporation's  stock or other  securities  or any portion

     thereof or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other

     occurrence relating to the Corporation or any stock of the Corporation, and

     provisions  restricting  the ability of the  Corporation  to enter into any

     such transaction absent an assumption by the other party or parties thereto

     of the obligations of the Corporation under such rights.



          (d) Provisions which deny the holder of a specified  percentage of the

     assent or vote of the  stockholders  to adopt,  amend,  alter or repeal the

     Amended By-Laws of the  Corporation,  except to the extent that the Amended

     By-Laws or this Restated Certificate of Incorporation otherwise provide.

<PAGE>



          SEVENTH:  (a) The  business  and affairs of the  Corporation  shall be

     managed  by or under the  direction  of its Board of  Directors,  which may

     exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and

     things as are not by law or by this Restated  Certificate of  Incorporation

     directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.



          (b)  The  number  of  Directors  constituting  the  initial  Board  of

     Directors shall be eleven (11) and thereafter the number of Directors shall

     be as set forth in or pursuant to the Amended  By-Laws of the  Corporation,

     but shall not be more than twenty-one (21). The Board of Directors shall be

     divided into three classes, designated Classes I, II and III, the number of

     directorships  in each of which  Classes shall be as nearly equal in number

     as possible.  At the annual meeting of stockholders  in 1995,  Directors of

     Class I were  elected for a term  expiring  at the 1996  annual  meeting of

     stockholders, Directors of Class II were elected for a term expiring at the

     1997 annual meeting of stockholders and Directors of Class III were elected

     for a term  expiring at the 1998 annual  meeting of  stockholders.  At each

     succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, the respective successors of the

     Directors whose terms are then expiring shall be elected for terms expiring

     at the annual meeting of stockholders  held in the third  succeeding  year.

     Vacancies  in the  Board of  Directors  may be filled  as  provided  in the

     Amended  By-Laws.  If the number of Directors is changed,  any increases or

     decreases  shall be  apportioned  among  the  Classes  so as to  attain  or

     maintain in each Class a number of directors as nearly equal as  reasonably

     possible.  The holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at

     an election of  Directors  may remove any  Director or the entire  Board of

     Directors, but only for cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the election,

     term,  removal and filling of vacancies  with respect to Directors  elected

     separately  by the holders of one or more series of  Preferred  Stock shall

     not be governed by this  Article  SEVENTH,  but rather shall be as provided

     for  in  the  Preferred  Stock  Certificate  of  Designation  creating  and

     establishing such series of Preferred Stock.

<PAGE>



          (c) Advance notice of nominations by stockholders  for the election of

     Directors, and of stockholder proposals regarding action to be taken at any

     meeting  of  stockholders,  shall be given in the  manner and to the extent

     provided in the Amended By-Laws of the Corporation.



          EIGHTH:  (a)  A  Director  shall  not  be  personally  liable  to  the

     Corporation  or  its  stockholders  for  monetary  damages  for  breach  of

     fiduciary  duty as a  Director;  provided  that  this  provision  shall not

     eliminate  or limit the  liability  of a Director (i) for any breach of his

     duty of loyalty to the  Corporation or its  stockholders,  (ii) for acts or

     omissions  not in good faith or which involve  intentional  misconduct or a

     knowing  violation  of the law,  (iii)  under  Section  174 of the  General

     Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,  or (iv) for any transaction from

     which the Director  derives an improper  personal  benefit.  If the General

     Corporation  Law of the State of  Delaware  is amended  after the filing of

     this Restated  Certificate of Incorporation  to authorize  corporate action

     further  eliminating or limiting the personal liability of Directors,  then

     the  liability  of a Director of the  Corporation  shall be  eliminated  or

     limited to the fullest extent  permitted by the General  Corporation Law of

     the State of Delaware, as so amended.



          Any  repeal  or  modification  of  the  foregoing   paragraph  by  the

     stockholders  of the  Corporation  shall not adversely  affect any right or

     protection of a Director of the Corporation  existing in respect of any act

     or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.



          (b) The  Corporation  shall  indemnify,  to the fullest  extent now or

     hereafter  permitted  by  the  General  Corporation  Law of  the  State  of

     Delaware,  any person who was or is a party or is  threatened  to be made a

     party to any threatened,  pending or completed action,  suit or proceeding,

     whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative, by reason of the

     fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to become a Director or officer

     of the  Corporation,  or is or was  serving  or has  agreed to serve at the

     request of the Corporation as a Director or officer of another corporation,

     partnership,  joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any

     action alleged to be taken or omitted in such capacity, and may to the same



<PAGE>



     extent  indemnify  any person who was or is a party or is  threatened to be

     made a party to such an action,  suit or  proceeding  by reason of the fact

     that he or she is or was or has  agreed to become an  employee  or agent of

     the Corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request

     of  the  Corporation  as an  employee  or  agent  of  another  corporation,

     partnership,  joint venture,  trust or other  enterprise,  against expenses

     (including  attorneys'  fees),   judgments,   fines  and  amounts  paid  in

     settlement in connection with such action, suit or proceeding or any appeal

     therefrom.



          NINTH:  A  Director  of  the  Corporation,   in  determining  what  he

(i) for any breach of such director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its

stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve

intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Title 8,

section 174 of the Delaware Code or (iv) for any transaction from which such

director derived an improper personal benefit.



         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the corporation has caused this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation to be executed this 18th day of August, 2000.

applicable law, the Corporation shall have the power to issue and sell all or

any part of any shares of any class of stock herein or hereafter authorized to

such persons, and for such consideration, as the Board of Directors shall from

time to time, in its discretion, determine, whether or not greater

consideration could be received upon the issue or sale of the same number of

shares of another class, and as otherwise permitted by law. Unless approved by

the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the voting power of the

shares of capital stock of the Corporation then entitled to vote at an

election of directors, the Corporation shall not take any action that would

Preferred Stock purchase rights may be distributed to stockholders that

provide all stockholders, other than persons who meet certain criteria

specified in the arrangement, the right to purchase the Common Stock or

Preferred Stock at less than the prevailing market price of the Common Stock

or Preferred Stock), unless (i) such rights plan is ratified by the

affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital

stock of the Corporation then entitled to vote at an election of directors at

the next meeting (annual or special) of stockholders; (ii) by its terms, such

rights plan expires within thirty-seven (37) months from the date of its

adoption, unless extended by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting

power of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation then entitled to vote

at an election of directors; and (iii) at any time the rights issued

of shares entitled to vote at an election of directors at a duly called

meeting of such holders, provided that no director shall be removed for cause

except by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the voting power

of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, and provided

further that if less than the entire board of directors is to be removed, no

director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal

would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of

the entire board of directors.



(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more

classes or series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the

right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual

or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of

vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the

terms of this Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto.



(2) A director shall hold office until the succeeding annual meeting (or

special meeting in lieu thereof) and until his or her successor shall be

elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation,

retirement, disqualification or removal from office.



(3) Any vacancy on the Board of Directors, regardless of whether resulting

from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office,

increase in the size of the Board or otherwise, may be filled by the

affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, but any vacancy

filled in such manner shall be filled only until the next annual meeting of

stockholders.



d. No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its

stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,

except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to

the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good

faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,

(iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the GCL or (iv) for any transaction from

which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any repeal or

modification of this Article SIXTH by the stockholders of the Corporation

shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the

Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect

to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.



e. In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by statute

expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise

all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by

the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the GCL, this

Certificate of Incorporation, and any By-Laws adopted by the stockholders;

provided, however, that no such action by the Board of Directors, unless

approved by a majority of the voting shares of capital stock of the

Corporation then entitled to vote at an election of directors, shall amend,

alter, change or repeal the right of stockholders as provided for in the By-

Laws to call a special meeting of stockholders; and provided further that no

By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act

of the directors which would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been

adopted.



5



* * *



SEVENTH: Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of

Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept

(subject to any provision contained in the GCL) outside the State of Delaware

at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of

Directors or in the By-Laws of the Corporation.



EIGHTH: Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of

stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special

meeting of stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice,

and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the

action so taken, shall be signed by holders of outstanding stock having not

less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or

take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon

were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation delivery to

its registered office, its principal place of business or an officer or

director of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of

meetings of members are recorded.



NINTH: Pursuant to § 203(b)(1) of the GCL, the Corporation hereby expressly

opts not to be governed by GCL § 203.



TENTH: Any action by the Board of Directors to make, alter, amend, change, add

to or repeal this Certificate of Incorporation shall be approved by the

affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the voting power of the shares

of capital stock of the Corporation then entitled to vote at an election of

directors. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or

repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the

manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon

stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

Incorporation to be executed on its behalf this 1st day of August, 2005\.

      (2) The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution

or resolutions, to provide, out of the unissued shares of Series Common Stock,

shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Restated Certificate of

Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series

of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock) that relates solely to the terms of

one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock if the

holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with

the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this

Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations

relating to any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock) or pursuant to

the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.



            (b) Except as otherwise required by law, holders of a series of

Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled only to such

voting rights, if any, as shall expressly be granted thereto by this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating

to such series).



            (c) Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders

of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class

or series of stock having a preference over or the right to participate with the

Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends, dividends may be declared

and paid on the Common Stock at such times and in such amounts as the Board of

Directors in its discretion shall determine.

made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding

(brought in the right of the corporation or otherwise), whether civil, criminal,

administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal, including

appeals, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer

of the corporation or, if a director or officer of the corporation, by reason of

the fact that such person is or was serving at the request of the corporation as

a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation,

partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other

enterprise, for and against all expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,

fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such

person or such heirs, executors or administrators in connection with such

action, suit or proceeding, including appeals. Notwithstanding the preceding

sentence, the corporation shall be required to indemnify a person described in

such sentence in connection with any action, suit or proceeding (or part

thereof) commenced by such person only if the commencement of such action, suit

or proceeding (or part thereof) by such person was authorized by the Board of

Directors of the corporation. The corporation may indemnify any person (and such

person's heirs, executors or administrators) who was or is a party or is

threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,

suit or proceeding (brought in the right of the corporation or otherwise),

whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or

informal, including appeals, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an

employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the

corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of

another corporation, for and against all expenses (including attorneys' fees),

judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred

by such person or such heirs, executors or administrators in connection with

such action, suit or proceeding, including appeals.



            (b) The corporation shall promptly pay expenses incurred by (i) any

person whom the corporation is obligated to indemnify pursuant to the first

sentence of subsection (a) of this Article Sixth, Section (1) or (ii) any person

whom the corporation has determined to indemnify pursuant to the third sentence

of subsection (a) of this Article Sixth, Section (1), in defending any action,

suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or

proceeding, including appeals, upon presentation of appropriate documentation.



            (c) The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of

any person described in subsection (a) of this Article Sixth, Section (1)

against any liability asserted against such person, whether or not the

corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability

under the provisions of this Article Sixth, Section (1) or otherwise.



            (d) The provisions of this Article Sixth, Section (1) shall be

applicable to all actions, claims, suits or proceedings made or commenced after

the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring

before or after its adoption. The provisions of this Article Sixth, Section (1)

shall be deemed to be a contract between the corporation and each



<PAGE>   5

                                       4



director or officer who serves in such capacity at any time while this Article

Sixth, Section (1) and the relevant provisions of the laws of the State of

Delaware and other applicable law, if any, are in effect, and any repeal or

modification hereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing

with respect to any state of facts or any action, suit or proceeding then or

theretofore existing, or any action, suit or proceeding thereafter brought or

threatened based in whole or in part on any such state of facts. If any

provision of this Article Sixth, Section (1) shall be found to be invalid or

limited in application by reason of any law or regulation, it shall not affect

the validity of the remaining provisions hereof. The rights of indemnification

provided in this Article Sixth, Section (1) shall neither be exclusive of, nor

be deemed in limitation of, any rights to which an officer, director, employee

or agent may otherwise be entitled or permitted by contract, this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation, vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise, or

as a matter of law, both as to actions in such person's official capacity and

actions in any other capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of

the corporation that indemnification of any person whom the corporation is

obligated to indemnify pursuant to the first sentence of subsection (a) of this

Article Sixth, Section (1) shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law.



            (e) For purposes of this Article Sixth, references to ""other

enterprises"" shall include employee benefit plans; references to ""fines"" shall

include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee

benefit plan; and references to ""serving at the request of the corporation""

shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the

corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director,

officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its

participants, or beneficiaries.



            (2) A director of the corporation shall not be liable to the

corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary

duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or

limitation thereof is not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment,

modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any

right or protection of a director of the corporation hereunder in respect of any

act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or

repeal.



            SEVENTH: (1) The business and affairs of the corporation shall be

managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less

than three directors, the exact number of directors to be determined from time

to time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of

Directors. The directors shall be divided into three classes designated Class I,

Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of

one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of

Directors. Class I directors shall be originally elected for a term expiring at

the succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, Class II directors shall be

originally elected for a term expiring at the second succeeding annual meeting

of stockholders, and Class III directors shall be originally elected for a term

expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. At each

succeeding annual meeting of stockholders following 2000, successors to the

class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected

for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting. If the number of

directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the

classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal

as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a newly

created directorship

<PAGE>   6

                                       5



resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall

coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease

in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director.

A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his

term expires and until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify,

subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or

removal from office. Any newly created directorship on the Board of Directors

that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy

occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of the

directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining

director. If any applicable provision of the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware expressly confers power on stockholders to fill such a

directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be

filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of

the voting power of all shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally in

the election of directors voting as a single class. Any director elected to fill

a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have

the same remaining term as that of his predecessor. Directors may be removed

only for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent in

voting power of all shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the

election of directors, voting as a single class.



            (2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one

or more series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock issued by the

corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately as

a class with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or

special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, filling

of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the

terms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate

of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common

Stock) applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided

into classes pursuant to this Article Seventh unless expressly provided by such

terms.



            EIGHTH: Any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders

of the Common Stock of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual

or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in

writing by such holders. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the

rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock,

special meetings of stockholders of the corporation may be called only by the

Chief Executive Officer of the corporation or by the Board of Directors pursuant

to a resolution approved by the Board of Directors.



            NINTH: Notwithstanding anything contained in this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the

holders of at least 80 percent in voting power of all the shares of the

corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting

together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Article

Fifth, Article Seventh, Article Eighth or this Article Ninth or to adopt any

provision inconsistent therewith.""



            The New D&B Corporation does hereby further certify that this

Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly adopted by unanimous written

consent of the stockholders in accordance with the provisions of Sections 228,

242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

OF



THE DUN & BRADSTREET CORPORATION



The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, a corporation duly organized and existing

under and by virtue of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,

does hereby certify:



| 1. | The name of the corporation is The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, and

the original Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation was filed with

the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on April 25, 2000 under the

name of The New D&B Corporation.  

---|---|---  

  

| 2. | This Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly adopted by the

Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of Section 245 of the

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and it restates and

integrates but does not further amend the provisions of the corporations

Certificate of Incorporation as heretofore amended and restated, and there is

no discrepancy between those provisions and the provisions of this Restated

Certificate of Incorporation.  

---|---|---  

  

| 3. | The text of the Certificate of Incorporation as amended or supplemented

heretofore is hereby restated without further amendments or changes to read as

follows:  

---|---|---  

  

FIRST: The name of the corporation is The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.



SECOND: The registered office of the corporation in the State of Delaware is

located at 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, County of New

Castle; and the name of its registered agent at such address is The

Corporation Trust Company.



THIRD: The purposes of the corporation are to engage in any lawful act or

activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation

Law of the State of Delaware.



FOURTH: (1) The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the

corporation shall have authority to issue is 220,000,000, consisting of (1)

10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (Preferred

Stock), (2) 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share

(Common Stock), and (3) 10,000,000 shares of Series Common Stock, par value

$.01 per share (Series Common Stock). The number of authorized shares of any

of the Preferred Stock, the Common Stock or the Series Common Stock may be

increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then

outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting

power of the stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of

the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the

holders of any of the Preferred Stock, the Common Stock or the Series Common

Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.



(2) The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or

resolutions, to provide, out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock, for

series of Preferred Stock and, with respect to each such series, to fix the

number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such series,

the voting powers (if any) of the shares of such series, and the



1



* * *



preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if

any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the

shares of such series. The powers, preferences and relative, participating,

optional and other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the

qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from

those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. Pursuant to the

authority conferred upon the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors

created a series of 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock designated as Series A

Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) by

filing a Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock of the

corporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on September

8, 2000, and created a series of 1,400,000 shares of Preferred Stock

designated as Series B Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock) by

filing a Certificate of Designation of Series B Preferred Stock of the

corporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February

24, 2009, and the designations, voting powers, preferences and relative,

participating, optional and other special rights, and qualifications,

limitations or restrictions of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B

Preferred Stock are set forth in Appendix A and Appendix B hereto,

respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.



(3) The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or

resolutions, to provide, out of the unissued shares of Series Common Stock,

for series of Series Common Stock and, with respect to each such series, to

fix the number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such

series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of such series, and the

preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if

any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the

shares of such series. The powers, preferences and relative, participating,

optional and other special rights of each series of Series Common Stock, and

the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ

from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding.



(4) (a) Each holder of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one vote

for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on

which stockholders generally are entitled to vote; provided, however, that,

except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall

not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation

(including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred

Stock or Series Common Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more

outstanding series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock if the holders of

such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the

holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this

Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations

relating to any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock) or pursuant

to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.



(b) Except as otherwise required by law, holders of a series of Preferred

Stock or Series Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled only to such voting

rights, if any, as shall expressly be granted thereto by this Certificate of

Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to such

series).



(c) Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any

outstanding series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class or

series of stock having a preference over or the right to participate with the

Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends, dividends may be

declared and paid on the Common Stock at such times and in such amounts as the

Board of Directors in its discretion shall determine.

* * *



(d) Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation,

subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of

Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class or series of stock having

a preference over or the right to participate with the Common Stock with

respect to the distribution of assets of the corporation upon such

dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation, the holders of the

Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to receive the assets of the

corporation available for distribution to its stockholders ratably in

proportion to the number of shares held by them.



FIFTH: The Board of Directors shall be authorized to make, amend, alter,

change, add to or repeal the By-Laws of the corporation in any manner not

inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware, subject to the power of

the stockholders to amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the By-Laws made by

the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Certificate

of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of a

majority of the voting power of all shares of the corporation present in

person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote generally in the election

of directors, voting as a single class, shall be required in order for the

stockholders to alter, amend or repeal any provision of the By-laws which is

to the same effect as Article Fifth, Article Seventh, and Article Eighth of

this Certificate of Incorporation or to adopt any provision inconsistent

therewith.



SIXTH: (1) To the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of

Delaware:



(a) The corporation shall indemnify any person (and such persons heirs,

executors or administrators) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made

a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding

(brought in the right of the corporation or otherwise), whether civil,

criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal,

including appeals, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director

or officer of the corporation or, if a director or officer of the corporation,

by reason of the fact that such person is or was serving at the request of the

corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,

trust or other enterprise, for and against all expenses (including attorneys

fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably

incurred by such person or such heirs, executors or administrators in

connection with such action, suit or proceeding, including appeals.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the corporation shall be required to

indemnify a person described in such sentence in connection with any action,

suit or proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such person only if the

commencement of such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) by such

person was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The

corporation may indemnify any person (and such persons heirs, executors or

administrators) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to

any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (brought in

the right of the corporation or otherwise), whether civil, criminal,

administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal, including

appeals, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent

of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a

director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation,

for and against all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and

amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person or

such heirs, executors or administrators in connection with such action, suit

or proceeding, including appeals.



(b) The corporation shall promptly pay expenses incurred by (i) any person

whom the corporation is obligated to indemnify pursuant to the first sentence

of subsection (a) of this Article Sixth, Section (1) or (ii) any person whom

the corporation has determined to indemnify



3



* * *



pursuant to the third sentence of subsection (a) of this Article Sixth,

Section (1), in defending any action, suit or proceeding in advance of the

final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, including appeals, upon

presentation of appropriate documentation.



(c) The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any

person described in subsection (a) of this Article Sixth, Section (1) against

any liability asserted against such person, whether or not the corporation

would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the

provisions of this Article Sixth, Section (1) or otherwise.



(d) The provisions of this Article Sixth, Section (1) shall be applicable to

all actions, claims, suits or proceedings made or commenced after the adoption

hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or

after its adoption. The provisions of this Article Sixth, Section (1) shall be

deemed to be a contract between the corporation and each director or officer

who serves in such capacity at any time while this Article Sixth, Section (1)

and the relevant provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware and other

applicable law, if any, are in effect, and any repeal or modification hereof

shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any

state of facts or any action, suit or proceeding then or theretofore existing,

or any action, suit or proceeding thereafter brought or threatened based in

whole or in part on any such state of facts. If any provision of this Article

Sixth, Section (1) shall be found to be invalid or limited in application by

reason of any law or regulation, it shall not affect the validity of the

remaining provisions hereof. The rights of indemnification provided in this

Article Sixth, Section (1) shall neither be exclusive of, nor be deemed in

limitation of, any rights to which an officer, director, employee or agent may

otherwise be entitled or permitted by contract, this Certificate of

Incorporation, vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise, or as a matter

of law, both as to actions in such persons official capacity and actions in

any other capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the

corporation that indemnification of any person whom the corporation is

obligated to indemnify pursuant to the first sentence of subsection (a) of

this Article Sixth, Section (1) shall be made to the fullest extent permitted

by law.



(e) For purposes of this Article Sixth, references to other enterprises

shall include employee benefit plans; references to fines shall include any

excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan;

and references to serving at the request of the corporation shall include

any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which

imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee,

or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or

beneficiaries.



(2) A director of the corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or

its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a

director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation

thereof is not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of

Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment,

modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect

any right or protection of a director of the corporation hereunder in respect

of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment,

modification or repeal.



SEVENTH: (1) The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by

or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than

three directors, the exact number of directors to be determined from time to

time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of

Directors. Directors elected at the corporations 2011 annual meeting of

stockholders shall be elected for a term expiring at the corporations 2012

annual meeting of



4



* * *



stockholders. From and after the corporations 2012 annual meeting of

stockholders, the Board of Directors shall not be classified, and all

directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders for a term

expiring at the succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. A director shall

hold office until his term expires and until his successor shall be elected

and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement,

disqualification or removal from office. Any newly created directorship on the

Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors

and any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled only by a

majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a

sole remaining director. If any applicable provision of the General

Corporation Law of the State of Delaware expressly confers power on

stockholders to fill such a directorship at a special meeting of stockholders,

such a directorship may be filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote

of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares of the

corporation present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote

generally in the election of directors, voting as a single class. Any director

elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of

directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his predecessor.

Directors may be removed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a

majority of the voting power of all shares of the corporation present in

person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote generally in the election

of directors, voting as a single class.



(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more

series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock issued by the corporation

shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class

with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special

meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, filling of

vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the

terms of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of

designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock)

applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into

classes pursuant to this Article Seventh unless expressly provided by such

terms.



EIGHTH: (1) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of the

Common Stock of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or

special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in

writing by such holders, except if such action by written consent is taken in

accordance with the provisions of this Article Eighth and the corporations

By-Laws. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the

holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock, special

meetings of stockholders of the corporation may be called only by the Chief

Executive Officer of the corporation or by the Board of Directors pursuant to

a resolution approved by the Board of Directors, or upon the written request

made in accordance with and subject to the corporations By-Laws by holders of

record of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of all

outstanding shares of Common Stock of the corporation.



(2) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent

to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be as fixed by the

Board of Directors or as otherwise established under this Article Eighth. Any

person other than the corporation seeking to have the stockholders authorize

or take corporate action by consent in writing without a meeting shall, by

written request addressed to the Secretary of the corporation and delivered to

the corporation and signed by holders of record of not less than forty percent

(40%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Common Stock of the

corporation, request (and not subsequently revoke) that a record date be fixed

for such purpose.



5



* * *



(3) The request must describe the action that the stockholder proposes to take

by written consent and must contain the text of the proposal (including the

text of any resolutions to be effected by written consent), an agreement to

solicit consents in accordance with paragraph (7) of this Article Eighth, and

such other information, representations and agreements then required by the

corporations By-Laws, as though each stockholder making the request were

making a request for a special meeting of stockholders in furtherance of such

action, as to such action and as to the stockholder(s) making the request

(including the beneficial owners on whose behalf the request is made). Each

stockholder submitting the request shall update the information contained in

the request as then required by the corporations By-Laws as though such

stockholder were providing notice of business proposed to be brought before a

meeting of stockholders.



(4) In determining whether action by written consent has been requested by the

record holders of shares representing in the aggregate at least the requisite

percent required by paragraph (2) of this Article Eighth, multiple requests

delivered to the Secretary of the corporation will be considered together only

if each such request (x) identifies substantially the same proposed action, as

determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, and (y) has been dated and

delivered to the Secretary of the corporation within sixty (60) days of the

earliest dated request. Any requesting stockholder may revoke his, her or its

request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the

corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation. Any

disposition by a requesting stockholder after the date of the request of any

shares of Common Stock of the corporation (or of beneficial ownership of such

shares by the beneficial owner on whose behalf the request was made) shall be

deemed a revocation of the request with respect to such shares, and each

requesting stockholder and the applicable beneficial owner shall certify to

the Secretary of the corporation on the day prior to the record date set for

the action by written consent as to whether any such disposition has occurred.

If the unrevoked requests represent in the aggregate less than the requisite

percent, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may cancel the action by

written consent.



(5) Following receipt of the request for a record date for action by written

consent, the Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten

(10) business days after the date the request by holders of record of not less

than forty percent (40%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of

Common Stock of the corporation is received, determine the validity of the

request and whether the request relates to an action that may be taken by

written consent pursuant to this Article Eighth and, if appropriate, adopt a

resolution fixing the record date for such purpose. The record date for such

purpose shall be no more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the

resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and

shall not precede the date such resolution is adopted. If no record date has

been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10) business days following

the corporations receipt of the notice to fix a record date for such purpose,

the record date shall be the day on which the first signed consent is

delivered to the corporation in the manner described in paragraph (8) of this

Article Eighth; except that, if prior action by the Board of Directors is

required under the provisions of Delaware law and the Board of Directors

determines to take such prior action, the record date shall be at the close of

business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution

taking such prior action, and except that no record date shall be set for any

action that is not a proper subject for action by written consent pursuant to

paragraph (6) of this Article Eighth or for which consents are not to be

solicited as provided in paragraph (7) of this Article Eighth.

(6) The Board of Directors shall not be required to set a record date for an

action by written consent if: (i) the relevant request does not comply with

this Article Eighth or the corporations By-Laws; (ii) the request relates to

an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under

applicable law; (iii) the request is received by the corporation during the

period commencing 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the

immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders and ending on the date of

the next annual meeting; (iv) an identical or substantially similar item (a

Similar Item), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors (and

for the purposes of this clause (iv), the election of directors shall be

deemed a Similar Item with respect to all items of business involving the

election or removal of directors), was presented at a meeting of stockholders

held not more than 120 days before the request is received by the Secretary of

the corporation; (v) the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer of

the corporation has called or calls for an annual or special meeting of

stockholders to be held within 90 days after the request is received by the

Secretary of the corporation and the business to be conducted at such meeting

is a Similar Item, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors; or

(vi) such request was made in a manner that involved a violation of the proxy

rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable law.



(7) Stockholders may take action by written consent only if consents are

solicited pursuant to a consent solicitation conducted pursuant to Regulation

action must bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the

consent, and must be delivered to the corporation or its registered office in

the State of Delaware no earlier than fifty (50) days after the record date by

hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. No consent

shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless,

within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered in accordance

with the foregoing and not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the

record date, consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take

such action are so delivered to the corporation.



(9) In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Article

Eighth and applicable law, to the corporation of one or more written consents

to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the

corporation shall appoint one or more Inspectors of Election for the purpose

of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents

and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the Inspectors to perform such

review, no action by consent in writing and without a meeting shall be

effective until such Inspectors have completed their review, determined that

the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents delivered to the

corporation in accordance with this Article Eighth and applicable law have

been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and

certified such determination for entry in the records of the corporation kept

for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders.

Nothing contained herein shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply

that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to

contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or

after such certification by the Inspectors, or to take any other action

(including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of

any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in

such litigation).

                                  CAPITAL STOCK

     A. Authorized Shares. The aggregate number of shares that the Corporation

shall have authority to issue is Ten Million (10,000,000) shares of Preferred

Stock, One Cent ($.01) par value per share, and One Hundred Million

(100,000,000) shares of Common Stock, One Cent ($.01) par value per share.

     B. Preferred and Common Stock. The designations, preferences, voting powers

and relative, participating, optional other special rights of the Preferred

Stock and the Common Stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions

of such preferences and rights, shall be in accordance with Sections B(1)

through B(6) of this Article III.

         1. Issuance of Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock may be issued from

time to time, in one or more series, each of which series shall be designated by

such appropriate designations as may be stated in such amendment or amendments

to these Articles of Incorporation providing for the issuance of the stock of

such series as may be adopted by the Board of Directors from time to time, a

copy of which amendment or amendments shall have been filed with and made

effective (without shareholder approval) by the State Corporation Commission of

Virginia as required by law. Subject to the provisions hereof, all shares of any

one series shall be alike in every particular and except for the relative rights

and preferences as to which there may be variations between different series as

set forth in this Article III, all shares of Preferred Stock shall be alike in

every particular. The Board of Directors shall have power and authority, subject

to all the provisions of these Articles and of the Virginia Stock Corporation

Act, to state and determine, in the amendment or amendments providing for the

issue of each series of Preferred Stock, the number of shares of each such

series authorized to be issued and the preferences and relative, participating,

optional and other rights pertaining to each such series, and the

qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including, full power and

authority to determine, as to the Preferred Stock of each such series (a) the

rate of dividend, the time of payment, whether dividends shall be cumulative and

if so, the dates from which



                                       1



<PAGE>



dividends shall be cumulative, and the extent of participation rights, if any,

corporate action, and the number of votes, if any, to be exercised for each

share, (c) the price at and the terms and conditions on which shares may be

redeemed, (d) the amount payable upon shares in event of involuntary

liquidation, (e) the amount payable upon shares in event of voluntary

liquidation, (f) sinking fund provisions for the redemption or purchase of

shares, (g) the terms and conditions on which shares may be converted if the

shares of any series are issued with the privilege of conversion, and (h) any

other designations, rights, preferences or limitations that are now or hereafter

permitted by law and are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Section

B(1).

         2. Dividends. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to

receive dividends as and when declared by the Board of Directors out of funds

legally available therefor. Dividends on the Preferred Stock of each series

shall be at such rates or to such extent, payable in such manner, under such

conditions and on such dates as shall be stated in the amendment to the Articles

of Incorporation providing for the issuance of each such series of Preferred

Stock. The holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends

as may from time to time be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds

legally available therefor, subject to the rights of the series of Preferred

Stock outstanding from time to time. Dividends on Preferred Stock shall be in

preference to dividends on Common Stock, unless otherwise determined by the

Board in the amendment or amendments providing for an issue of Preferred Stock.

         3. Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary

liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, there shall be paid

to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock of each series the fixed amount per

share payable in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the

Corporation, stated in the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation providing

for the issuance of each such series of Preferred Stock, plus the unpaid

dividends accrued thereon, if such dividends be cumulative, before any sum shall

be paid to, or any assets distributed among, the holders of the Common Stock,

but the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to no further payment

or distribution than as provided above. If amounts payable to holders of shares

of Preferred Stock on liquidation, dissolution or winding up are not paid in

full, the shares of Preferred Stock shall share in any distribution of assets

(other than by way of dividends) on a basis determined by the Board in the

amendment or amendments providing for the issue of each series of Preferred

Stock, or, in the absence of such determination, the shares of Preferred Stock

shall share ratably on a share for share basis in accordance with the sums which

would be payable in such distribution if all sums payable were discharged in

full. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or

winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall be

entitled, in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock so held, to

payment or distribution of any assets remaining after all required payments to

holders of Preferred Stock. A liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the

Corporation, as such terms are used in this Section B(3), shall not be deemed to

be occasioned by or to include any consolidation or merger of the Corporation

with or into any other corporation or corporations or a sale, lease or

conveyance of all or part of



                                       2

its assets.

         4.   Redemption. The Preferred Stock of each series shall be subject to

redemption if so provided, and at the prices, and upon the terms and

conditions stated, in the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation providing

for the issuance of each such series of Preferred Stock.

          5. Voting. The holders of each series of the Preferred Stock shall

have no voting power except as may be required by law, or as may be provided,

Incorporation providing for the issuance of each such series of Preferred Stock.

vested in the holders of the Common Stock. Each holder of the Common Stock shall

have one vote for each share held by him, and each holder of any series of

Preferred Stock when and if entitled to vote shall also have such votes for each

share held by him as provided in the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation

providing for the issuance of each such series of Preferred Stock.

         6. Pre-emptive Rights. No holder of any share of capital stock of the

Corporation, whether now or hereafter authorized or outstanding, shall have any

pre-emptive or preferential right to purchase or subscribe to purchase i) any

shares of stock of any class of the Corporation or other security that the

Corporation may determine to issue, whether share of stock or other security to

be issued is now or hereafter authorized, ii) any warrants, rights or options to

purchase any stock or other security , or iii) any obligation convertible into

any such stock or other security or into warrants, rights or options to purchase

any such stock or other security.



                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    DIRECTORS

     The number of directors shall be fixed by the By-Laws. In the absence of

such a provision in the By-Laws, the number of directors shall be nine. Upon the

effective date of these Third Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of

Directors shall divide the directors of the corporation into three classes as

nearly equal in number as possible. The term of office of the first class of

directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of stockholders after the

initial election dividing directors into such classes, that of the second class

shall expire at the second annual meeting after such election, and that of the

third class at the third annual meeting after such election. At each annual

meeting of stockholders, successors to the class of directors whose terms shall

then expire and any other nominees for election as a director of such class

shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting. If

the number of directors is changed, any newly created directorships or decrease

in directorships shall be so apportioned among the classes by the Board of

Directors as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible.

Vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be created

and filled by action of the Board of Directors between annual meetings of

stockholders. A director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to

remove the director constitutes more than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes entitled

to be cast at an election of directors.



                                    ARTICLE V

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     A.  Definitions.  For purposes of this Article, the following definitions



                                       3



<PAGE>



shall apply:

         ""Act"" means the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, as it exists on the

date hereof or is hereafter amended, or any successor or comparable provision of

law if such Act is repealed.



         ""eligible person"" means a person who is or was a director or officer of

the Corporation, or while serving as such director or officer, is or was serving

at the request of the Corporation as a director, trustee, partner or officer of

another corporation, affiliated corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,

employee benefit plan or other enterprise. A person shall be considered to be

serving an employee benefit plan at the Corporation's request if his duties to

the Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him to

the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan.



         ""expenses"" includes, without limitation, counsel fees, expert witness

fees, and costs of investigation, litigation and appeal, as well as any amounts

expended in asserting a claim for indemnification.



         ""liability"" means the obligation to pay a judgment, settlement,

penalty, fine (including any excise tax assessed with respect to any employment

benefit plan), or reasonable expenses incurred with respect to a proceeding.



         ""party"" includes, without limitation, an individual who was, is, or is

threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.



         ""proceeding"" means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit,

or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative and

whether formal or informal.



     B.  Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

         1. To the full extent that the Act permits the limitation or

elimination of the liability of directors and officers, no director or officer

of the Corporation made a party to any proceeding shall be liable to the

Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages arising out of any

transaction, occurrence or course of conduct, whether occurring prior or

subsequent to the effective date of this Article V.

         2. To the full extent permitted by the Act, the Corporation shall

indemnify any eligible person who was or is a party to any proceeding, including

a proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation or brought by or on

behalf of the stockholders of the Corporation, against any liability incurred by

him in connection with such proceeding unless he engaged in willful misconduct

or a knowing violation of the criminal law. To the same extent, the Board of

Directors is hereby empowered, by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested

directors, to enter into a contract to indemnify any director or officer against

liability and/or to advance or reimburse his expenses in respect to any

proceedings arising from any act or omission, whether occurring before or after

the execution of such contract.

         3. The provisions of this Article V shall be applicable to all

proceedings commenced after it becomes effective, arising from any act or

omission, whether occurring before or after such effective date. No amendment or

repeal of this Article V shall impair or otherwise diminish the rights



                                       4



<PAGE>



provided under this Article V (including those created by contract) with respect

to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. The

Corporation shall promptly take all such actions and make all such

determinations and authorizations as shall be necessary or appropriate to comply

with its obligation to make any indemnity against liability, or to advance any

expenses, under this Article V and shall promptly pay or reimburse all

reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such director or

officer in connection with such actions and determinations or proceedings of any

kind arising therefrom.

         4. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,

conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of

itself create a presumption that the director or officer did not meet any

standard of conduct that is a prerequisite to the limitation or elimination of

liability provided in Section B(1) of this Article V or to his entitlement to

indemnification under Section B(2) of this Article V.

         5. No indemnification under Section B(2) of this Article V (unless

ordered by a court of law) shall be made by the Corporation without a

determination in the specific case that indemnification is proper in the

circumstances because the proposed indemnitee has met the standard of conduct

that is a prerequisite to his entitlement to indemnification under Section B(2)

of this Article V.

         The determination shall be made:

     (a)      By the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum

consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

     (b) If a quorum cannot be obtained under subsection (a) of this Section

B(5), by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the Board of Directors

(in which designation directors who are parties may participate), consisting

solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

     (c)      By special legal counsel:

          i)  selected by the Board of Directors in the manner prescribed in

              subsection (a) of this Section B(5) or its committee in the manner

              prescribed in subsection (b) of this Section B(5); or



          ii)     if a quorum of the Board of Directors cannot be obtained

                  under subsection (a) of this Section B(5) and a committee

                  cannot be designated under subsection (b) of this Section

                  B(5), selected by a majority vote of the full Board of

                  Directors including directors who are parties; or



     (d)      By the stockholders, but shares owned by or voted under the

control of directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not be

voted on the determination.

         Authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of

expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that

indemnification is appropriate, except that if the determination is made by

special legal counsel, such authorizations and evaluations shall be made by

those entitled under subsection (c) of this Section B(5) to select counsel.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there has been a change in

the composition of a majority of the Board of Directors after the date of the

alleged act or omission with respect to which indemnification, an advance or

reimbursement is claimed, any determination as to such indemnification,



                                       5



<PAGE>



advance or reimbursement shall be made by special legal counsel agreed upon by

the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee. If the Board of Directors

and the proposed indemnitee are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel,

the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee each shall select a nominee,

and the nominees shall select such special legal counsel.

         6. (a) The Corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable

expenses incurred by a director or officer (and may do so for a person referred

to in Section B(7) of this Article V) who is a party to a proceeding in advance

of final disposition of the proceeding or the making of any determination under

Section B(2) of this Article V if the director, officer or person furnishes to

the Corporation:

         i)  a written statement, executed personally, of his good faith belief

    that he has met the standard of conduct that is a prerequisite to his

    entitlement to indemnification under Section B(2) of this Article V; and



         ii)     a written undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to

    repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he did not meet

    such standard of conduct.



              (b) The undertaking required by paragraph (ii) of subsection (a)

of this Section B(6) shall be an unlimited general obligation but need not be

secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make

repayment.

              (c) Authorizations of payments under this Section B(6) shall be

made by the persons specified in Section B(5) of this Article V.

         7. The Board of Directors is hereby empowered, by majority vote of a

quorum consisting of disinterested directors, to cause the Corporation to

indemnify or contract to indemnify any person not specified in Section B(2) of

this Article V who was, is or may become a party to any proceeding, by reason of

the fact that he is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was

serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or

agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee

benefit plan or other enterprise, to the same or a lesser extent as if such

person were specified as one to whom indemnification is granted in Section B(2)

of this Article V. The provisions of Sections B(3) through B(6) of this Article

V shall be applicable to any indemnification provided pursuant to this Section

B(7).

         8. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify it

against the whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it in accordance

with this Article V and may also procure insurance, in such amounts as the Board

of Directors may determine, on behalf of any person who is or was a director,

officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the

request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other

enterprise, against any liability asserted against or incurred by him in any

such capacity or arising from his status as such, whether or not the Corporation

would have power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of

this Article V.

         9. Every reference herein to directors, officers, employees or agents

shall include former directors, officers, employees and agents and their

respective heirs, executors and administrators. The indemnification hereby

provided and provided hereafter pursuant to the power hereby conferred by this



                                       6



<PAGE>



Article V on the Board of Directors shall not be exclusive of any other rights

to which any person may be entitled, including any right under policies of

insurance that may be purchased and maintained by the Corporation or others,

with respect to claims, issues or matters in relation to which the Corporation

would not have the power to indemnify such person under the provisions of this

Article V. Nothing herein shall prevent or restrict the power of the Corporation

to make or provide for any further indemnity, or provisions for determining

entitlement to indemnity, or provisions for indemnification agreements, By-Laws,

or other arrangements (including, without limitation, creation of trust funds or

security interests funded by letters of credit or other means) approved by the

Board of Directors (whether or not any of the directors of the Corporation shall

be a party to or beneficiary of any such agreements, By-Laws or arrangements);

provided, however, that any provision of such agreements, By-Laws or other

arrangements shall not be effective if and to the extent that it is determined

to be contrary to this Article V or applicable laws of the Commonwealth of

Virginia, but other provisions of any such agreements, By-Laws or other

arrangements shall not be affected by any such determination.

         10. Each provision of this Article V shall be severable, and an adverse

determination as to any such provision shall in no way affect the validity of

any other provision.



                                   ARTICLE VI

                                   AMENDMENTS

     Adoption of an amendment to Article IV or this Article VI of these Third

Restated Articles of Incorporation, or Articles II(3), II(5), III(2), III(3), or

III(4) of the Second Restated By-Laws requires, of each voting group entitled to

vote thereon, approval of the amendment by more than two-thirds of all the votes

entitled to be cast by that voting group. Adoption of all other amendments to

the Articles of Incorporation requires, of each voting group entitled to vote

thereon, approval of the amendment by a majority of a quorum of the voting

group. Nothing in this Article VI shall be construed to require shareholder

approval of an amendment or amendments to these Articles of Incorporation

providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock in accordance with

Article III(B) of these Articles of Incorporation.



                                   ARTICLE VII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     A.  The Corporation elects not to be governed by Article 14 of the Act,

entitled ""Affiliated Transactions.""

     B. The Corporation elects not to be governed by Article 14.1 of the Act,

acquisitions of shares of the Corporation.

<PAGE>   4

         SECTION 2.       DISTRIBUTIONS.  At the time of each Distribution,

such Distribution shall be made  to the holders of Class A Common Stock and

Common Stock in the following priority:



                 (i)      The holders of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled

to receive all or a portion of such Distribution (ratably among such holders

based upon the number of shares of Class A Common Stock held by each such

holder as of the time of such Distribution) equal to the aggregate Unreturned

Original Cost of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock as of the time

of such Distribution, and no Distribution or any portion thereof shall be made

shall be proportionately subdivided or combined.  All such subdivisions and

combinations shall be payable only in Class A Common Stock to the holders of

Class A Common Stock and in Common Stock to the holders of Common Stock.  In no

event shall a stock split or stock dividend constitute a return of Original

Cost.



         SECTION 4.       CONVERSION.  Immediately prior to the Public Offering

Time, each share of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the

any class of Common Shares at such place, the Corporation shall, at the request

of the registered holder of such certificate, execute and deliver a new

certificate or certificates in exchange therefor representing in the aggregate

the number of shares of such class represented by the surrendered certificate,

and the Corporation forthwith shall cancel such surrendered certificate.  Each

such new certificate will be registered in such name and will represent such

number of shares of such class as is requested by the holder of the surrendered

certificate and shall be substantially identical in form to the surrendered

certificate.  The issuance of new certificates shall be made without charge to

the holders of the surrendered certificates for any issuance tax in respect

thereof or other cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with such

issuance.



         SECTION 6.       REPLACEMENT.  Upon receipt of evidence reasonably

satisfactory to the Corporation (an affidavit of the registered holder will be

satisfactory) of the ownership and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation

of any certificate evidencing one or more shares of any class of Common Shares,

and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of

indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation (provided that if the

holder is a financial institution or other institutional investor its own

agreement will be satisfactory), or, in the case of any such mutilation upon

surrender of such certificate, the Corporation shall (at its expense) execute

and deliver in lieu of such certificate a new certificate of like kind

representing the number of shares of such class represented by such lost,

stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate and dated the date of such lost,

stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate.

otherwise specified in a written notice to the Corporation by such holder).

provision of this Article Fourth shall be effective without the prior written

consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Common Shares

voting as a single class; provided that no amendment as to any terms or

provisions of, or for the benefit of, any class of Common Shares that adversely

Shares, voting as a single class.

         the form of cash, notes, securities, or other property), and the time

         or times at which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such

         shares shall be redeemable and the manner of redemption;

         exchangeable for the shares of any other class or classes or of any

         with respect to any class or series as may to the board of directors

         of the Corporation seem advisable.



         The shares of each class or series of the Preferred Stock may vary 

from the shares of any other class or series thereof in any or all of the

foregoing respects and in any other manner.  The board of directors of the

Corporation may increase the number of shares of the Preferred Stock designated

authorized and unissued shares of the Preferred Stock not designated for any

other class or series.  The board of directors of the Corporation may decrease

the number of shares of the Preferred Stock designated

        



                                      -7-

<PAGE>   8

for any existing class or series by a resolution subtracting from such class or

series authorized and unissued shares of the Preferred Stock designated for

such existing class or series, and the shares so subtracted shall become

authorized, unissued, and undesignated shares of the Preferred Stock.  The

number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased

(but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the

affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock,

without a vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof,

unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock

Series Resolution.

        

V.       NO PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS



         No holder of shares of stock of the Corporation shall have any

preemptive or other rights, except such rights as are expressly provided by

contract, to purchase or subscribe for or receive any shares of any class, or

series thereof, of stock of the Corporation, whether now or hereafter

authorized, or any warrants, options, bonds, debentures or other securities

convertible into, exchangeable for or carrying any right to purchase any shares

of any class, or series thereof, of stock; but such additional shares of stock

and such warrants, options, bonds, debentures or other securities convertible

into, exchangeable for or carrying any right to purchase any shares of any

class, or series thereof, of stock may be issued or disposed of by the board of

directors to such persons, and on such terms and for such lawful consideration,

as in its discretion it shall deem advisable or as to which the Corporation

shall have by binding contract agreed.



VI.      REGISTERED OWNER



         The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name

any share of its stock is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes and

shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest

in, such share on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation

shall have notice thereof, except as expressly provided by applicable law.



VII.     GENERAL



         Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Amended and Restated

Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation may issue shares of its Preferred

Stock and Common Stock from time to time for such consideration (not less than

the par value thereof) as may be fixed by the board of directors of the

Corporation, which is expressly authorized to fix the same in its absolute

discretion subject to the foregoing conditions.  Shares so issued for which the

consideration shall have been paid or delivered to the Corporation shall be

deemed fully paid stock and shall not be liable to any further call or

assessment thereon, and the holders of such shares shall not be liable for any

further payments in respect of such shares.



         The Corporation shall have authority to create and issue rights and

options entitling their holders to purchase shares of the Corporation's capital

stock of any class or series or other securities of the Corporation, and such

rights and options shall be evidenced by instrument(s) approved by the board of

directors of the Corporation.  The board of directors of the Corporation shall

be empowered to set the exercise price, duration, times for exercise, and other

terms of such rights or options;



                                      -8-

<PAGE>   9

provided, however, that the consideration to be received for any shares of

capital stock subject thereto shall not be less than the par value thereof.



         FIFTH:  The following provisions are inserted for the management of

the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for

further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation

and of its directors and stockholders:



I.       DIRECTORS



         The number, classification, and terms of the board of directors of the

Corporation and the procedures to elect directors, to remove directors, and to

fill vacancies in the board of directors shall be as follows:



                 (a)      The number of directors that shall constitute the

         whole board of directors shall from time to time be fixed exclusively

         by the board of directors by a resolution adopted by a majority of the

         whole board of directors serving at the time of that vote.  In no

         event shall the number of directors that constitute the whole board of

         directors be fewer than three.  No decrease in the number of directors

         shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent

         director.  Directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written

         ballot unless the by-laws of the Corporation otherwise provide.



                 (b)      The board of directors of the Corporation shall be

         divided into three classes designated Class I, Class II, and Class

         III, respectively, all as nearly equal in number as possible, with

         each director then in office receiving the classification that at

         least a majority of the board of directors designates.  The initial

         term of office of directors of Class I shall expire at the annual

         meeting of stockholders of the Corporation in 1997, of Class II shall

         expire at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation in

         1998, and of Class III shall expire at the annual meeting of

         stockholders of the Corporation in 1999, and in all cases as to each

         director until his successor is elected and qualified or until his

         earlier death, resignation or removal.  At each annual meeting of

         stockholders beginning with the annual meeting of stockholders in

         1997, each director elected to succeed a director whose term is then

         expiring shall hold his office until the third annual meeting of

         stockholders after his election and until his successor is elected and

         qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal.  If the

         number of directors that constitutes the whole board of directors is

         changed as permitted by this Article V, the majority of the whole

         board of directors that adopts the change shall also fix and determine

         the number of directors comprising each class; provided, however, that

         any increase or decrease in the number of directors shall be

         apportioned among the classes as equally as possible.



                 (c)     Vacancies in the board of directors resulting from

         death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office,

         or other cause and newly-created directorships resulting from any

         increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by no

         less than a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office,

         though less than a quorum, who are designated to represent the same

         class or classes of stockholders that the vacant position, when

         filled, is to represent or by the sole remaining director (but not by

         the stockholders except as required by law), and each director so

         chosen shall receive the

        



                                      -9-

<PAGE>   10

         classification of the vacant directorship to which he has been

         appointed or, if it is a newly-created directorship, shall receive the

         classification that at least a majority of the board of directors

         designates and shall hold office until the first meeting of

         stockholders held after his election for the purpose of electing

         directors of that classification and until his successor is elected

         and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation, or removal from

         office.

        

                (d)      A director of any class of directors of the

         Corporation may be removed before the expiration date of that

         director's term of office, only for cause, by an affirmative vote of

         the holders of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the votes of the

         outstanding shares of the class or classes or series of stock then

         entitled to be voted at an election of directors of that class or

         series, voting together as a single class, cast at the annual meeting

         of stockholders or at any special meeting of stockholders called by a

         majority of the whole board of directors for this purpose.



II.      POWER TO AMEND BY-LAWS



         The by-laws may be altered or repealed and new by-laws may be adopted

(a) at any annual or special meeting of stockholders if notice of the proposed

alteration, repeal or adoption of the new by-law or by-laws be contained in the

notice of such annual or special meeting by the affirmative vote of a majority

of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, voting

together as a single class, or (b) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the

members present at any regular meeting of the board of directors, or at any

special meeting of the board of directors, without any action on the part of

the stockholders, if notice of the proposed alteration, repeal or adoption of

the new by-law or by-laws be contained in the notice of such regular or special

meeting.



III.     STOCKHOLDERS' ACTION -- SPECIAL MEETINGS



         After October 15, 1996, no action required to be taken or that may be

taken at any meeting of common stockholders of the Corporation may be taken

without a meeting, and, after such date, the power of common stockholders to

consent in writing, without a meeting, to the taking of any action is

specifically denied.



         Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation, and any

proposals to be considered at such meetings, may be called and proposed

exclusively by (i) the Chairman of the Board, (ii) the President or (iii) the

board of directors, pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the

members of the board of directors at the time in office, and no stockholder of

the Corporation shall require the board of directors to call a special meeting

of common stockholders or to propose business at a special meeting of

stockholders.  Except as otherwise required by law or regulation, no business

proposed by a stockholder to be considered at an annual meeting of the

stockholders (including the nomination of any person to be elected as a

director of the Corporation) shall be considered by the stockholders at that

meeting unless, no later than ninety (90) days before the annual meeting of

stockholders or (if later) ten days after the first public notice of that

meeting is sent to stockholders, the Corporation receives from the stockholder

proposing that business a written notice that sets forth (1) the nature of the

proposed business with reasonable particularity, including the exact text of

any proposal to be presented for adoption, and the reasons for conducting that

business at the annual meeting; (2) with respect to each such stockholder, that

stockholder's name



                                      -10-

<PAGE>   11

and address (as they appear on the records of the Corporation), business

address and telephone number, residence address and telephone number, and the

number of shares of each class of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned

by that stockholder; (3) any interest of the stockholder in the proposed

business; (4) the name or names of each person nominated by the stockholder to

be elected or re-elected as a director, if any; and (5) with respect to each

nominee, that nominee's name, business address and telephone number, and

residence address and telephone number, the number of shares, if any, of each

class of stock of the Corporation owned directly and beneficially by that

nominee, and all information relating to that nominee that is required to be

disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is

otherwise required, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange

Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") (or any provision of law

subsequently replacing Regulation 14A), together with a duly acknowledged

letter signed by the nominee stating his or her acceptance of the nomination by

that stockholder, stating his or her intention to serve as director if elected,

and consenting to being named as a nominee for director in any proxy statement

relating to such election.  The person presiding at the annual meeting shall

determine whether business (including the nomination of any person as a

director) has been properly brought before the meeting and, if the facts so

warrant, shall not permit any business (or voting with respect to any

particular nominee) to be transacted that has not been properly brought before

the meeting.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Amended and Restated

Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise

permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the

holders of any particular class or series of the capital stock of the

Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of

Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than eighty

percent (80%) of the shares of the Corporation then entitled to be voted in an

election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to

amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article

Fifth.



         SIXTH:  ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND 

                 INDEMNIFICATION



I.       ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS



         No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its

stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty by such director

as a director, except for liability (a) for any breach of the director's duty

of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions

not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing

violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware, or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived

an improper personal benefit.  Any amendment or repeal of this Part I of this

Article Sixth shall be prospective only, and neither the amendment nor repeal

of this Part I of this Article Sixth shall eliminate or reduce the effect of

this Part I of this Article Sixth in respect of any matter occurring, or any

cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Part I of this Article Sixth

would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment or repeal.  If the Delaware

General Corporation Law hereafter is amended to authorize corporate action

further eliminating or limiting the liability of directors, then the liability

of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal

liability provided herein, shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent

permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended from time to

time.



                                      -11-

<PAGE>   12

II.      INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE



         SECTION 1.       RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION.  Each person who was or is

made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any

action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

investigative (hereinafter a ""proceeding""), by reason of the fact that he or

she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was or

has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was

serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director,

officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint

venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee

benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an

official capacity as a director or officer, or in any other capacity while

serving or having agreed to serve as a director or officer, shall be

indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent

authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may

hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the

extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader

indemnification rights than said Law permitted the Corporation to provide prior

to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including, without

limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes pursuant to the

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or penalties and amounts paid

or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in

connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who

has ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such person to

indemnity hereunder and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,

executors and administrators. The right to indemnification conferred in this

Part II of this Article Sixth shall be a contract right and shall include the

right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such

proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the

Delaware General Corporation Law requires, the payment of such expenses

incurred by a current, former or proposed director or officer in his or her

capacity as a director or officer or proposed director or officer (and not in

any other capacity in which service was or is or has been agreed to be rendered

by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation,

service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a

proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an

undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnified person, to repay all amounts

so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnified person

is not entitled to be indemnified under this Part II or otherwise.  The

Corporation may, by action of its board of directors, provide indemnification

to employees and agents of the Corporation, individually or as a group, with

the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and

officers.



         SECTION 2.       RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT.  If a written claim

from or on behalf of an indemnified party under Section 1 of this Part II is

not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after such written claim

has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter

bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim

and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be

paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any

such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses

incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where

the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the

Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes

it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation

to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving

such defense shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the

Corporation



                                      -12-

<PAGE>   13

(including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its

stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such

action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances

because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the

Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the

Corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or its

stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of

conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the

claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.



         SECTION 3.       NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS.  The right to

indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this

Part II shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or

hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Amended and Restated

Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or

disinterested directors or otherwise.



         SECTION 4.       INSURANCE.  The Corporation may maintain insurance,

at its expense, to protect itself and any person who is or was serving as a

director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at

the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,

including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against any expense,

liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to

indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the

Delaware General Corporation Law.



         SECTION 5.       SAVINGS CLAUSE.  If this Part II or any portion

hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent

jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and hold

harmless each director and officer of the Corporation, as to costs, charges and

expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in

settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,

criminal, administrative or investigative to the full extent permitted by any

applicable portion of this Part II that shall not have been invalidated and to

the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.



         SECTION 6.       DEFINITIONS.  For purposes of this Part II, reference

to the ""Corporation"" shall include, in addition to the Corporation, any

constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed

in a consolidation or merger prior to (or, in the case of an entity

specifically designated in a resolution of the board of directors, after) the

adoption hereof and which, if its separate existence had continued, would have

had the power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers and employees

or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or

agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of

such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,

shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Part II with

respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect

to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.



         SEVENTH:  No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one

or more of its directors, officers, or stockholders or between the Corporation

and any person (as used herein ""person"" means any corporation, partnership,

association, firm, trust, joint venture, political subdivision, or

instrumentality) or other organization in which one or more of its directors,

Board.

majority of a quorum of the shareholders, ratification by the shareholders of

in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation

of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 1053 of Title 18 of the OGCA, or (iv) for

         The total number of shares that may be issued by the Corporation is one

common stock without par value.



         The descriptions of the different classes of stock of the Corporation

and the preferences, designations, relative rights, privileges, powers,

restrictions, limitations and qualifications of said classes of stock are as

follows:



         DIVISION A--PREFERENCE STOCK



         1. Series and Limits of Variations between Series. Subject to the

provisions of Division B of this Article VI (which provisions, however, shall

not continue effective as to any shares which are redeemed or repurchased and

restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares), the preference stock

may be divided into and issued in one or more series from time to time as herein

provided, each series to be so designated as to distinguish the shares thereof

from the shares of all other series and classes. The authorized number of shares

of any such series, the designation of such series, and the terms and

characteristics thereof (in those respects in which the shares of one series may

vary from the shares of other series as herein provided) shall be fixed at any

time prior to the issuance thereof by resolution or resolutions of the board of

directors of the Corporation. The preference stock of all series shall be of the

same class and of equal rank and shall be identical in all respects, except that

there may be variations in the following particulars:



                  (a)   The rate at which annual dividends are to accrue on

         the shares of such series, hereinafter referred to as the ""fixed

         dividend rate;""



                  (b)   The terms and conditions on which the shares of such

         series may be redeemed, and the amount payable in respect of the shares

         of such series in case of the redemption thereof at the option of the

         Corporation (the amount so fixed being hereinafter referred to as the



                                       2

<PAGE>



         ""fixed redemption price""), and the amount payable in respect of the

         shares of such series in case of the redemption thereof for any sinking

         fund of such series, which amounts in respect of any series may, but

         need not, vary according to the time or circumstances of such action;



                  (c)   The amount payable in respect of the shares of such

         series in case of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the

         Corporation (the amount so fixed being hereinafter referred to as the

         ""fixed liquidation price""), and the amount payable, if any, in addition

         to the fixed liquidation price for each series, in case such

         liquidation, dissolution or winding up be voluntary (the amount so

         fixed being hereinafter referred to as the ""fixed liquidation

         premium""), which amounts in respect of any series may, but need not,

         vary according to the time or circumstances of such action;



                  (d)   Any requirement as to any sinking fund or purchase fund

         for, or the redemption, purchase or other retirement by the Corporation

         of, the shares of such series; and



                  (e)   The right, if any, to exchange or convert the shares of

         such series into shares of any other series of the preference stock,

         or, to the extent permitted by law, into shares of any other class of

         stock of the Corporation, and the rate or basis, time, manner and

         conditions of exchange or conversion or the method by which the same

         shall be determined.



         2. Dividends. Out of the assets of the Corporation legally available

for dividends, the holders of the preference stock of each series shall be

entitled, in preference to the holders of the common stock, to receive, but only

when and as declared payable by the board of directors, dividends at the fixed

dividend rate for such series, and no more, payable quarterly in each year, on

the dividend payment dates established for such series, or otherwise as the

board of directors may determine, to shareholders of record as of a date not

exceeding thirty (30) days nor less than ten (10) days preceding such dividend

payment dates, and such dividends on the preference stock shall be cumulative,

so that, if in any past dividend period or periods full dividends upon each

series of the outstanding preference stock at the fixed dividend rate or rates

therefor shall not have been paid, the deficiency (without interest) shall be

paid or declared and set apart for payment before any dividends shall be paid

upon or set apart for the common stock (other than a dividend payable in common

stock of the Corporation). Dividends on all shares of the preference stock of

each series shall commence to accrue and be cumulative from the dividend date

for such series next preceding the date of issue of the initial shares of such

series, or from said date of issue, if that be a dividend date or from a date

fixed by the board of directors at the time the relative rights and preferences

of such series are fixed and determined. Any dividends paid on the preference

stock in any amount less than full cumulative dividends accrued or in arrears

upon all preference stock outstanding shall, if more than one series be

outstanding, be divided between the different series in proportion to the

aggregate amounts which would be distributable to the preference stock of each

series if full cumulative dividends were declared and paid thereon.



         3. Preference on Liquidation, etc. In the event of any liquidation,

dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the preference

stock of each series shall have a preference over the holders of the common



                                       3

<PAGE>



stock until the fixed liquidation price per share for such series, plus, in case

such liquidation, dissolution or winding up shall have been voluntary, the fixed

liquidation premium per share for such series, if any, together in all cases

with unpaid accumulated dividends, if any, shall have been paid or distributed

or declared and set apart for payment or distribution, but the holders of the

preference stock shall be entitled to no further participation in any such

distribution. If upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the

assets distributable among the holders of the preference stock shall be

insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amounts aforesaid,

then the entire assets of the Corporation to be distributed shall be distributed

among the holders of each series of the preference stock then outstanding,

ratably in proportion to the full preferential amounts to which they are

respectively entitled. Nothing in this Section 3 shall be deemed to prevent the

purchase or redemption of preference stock in any manner permitted by Section 4

of this Division A, nor shall anything in this Section 3 be deemed to prevent

the purchase or redemption by the Corporation of shares of its common stock if

the requirements of Section 6 of this Division A shall be complied with. No such

purchase or redemption shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or

winding up of the Corporation or a distribution of assets to its common

shareholders within the meaning of this Section 3 whether or not shares of

common stock so redeemed or purchased shall be retired, nor shall a

consolidation or merger of the Corporation or a sale or transfer of

substantially all of its assets as an entirety be regarded as a liquidation,

dissolution or winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section

3.



         4. Redemption and Repurchase. The Corporation may at any time or from

time to time, by resolution of the board of directors, redeem (subject to any

terms of a particular series restricting refunding or redemption thereof) all or

any part of the preference stock, or of any series thereof, by paying in cash

the fixed redemption price applicable thereto plus the amount of unpaid

accumulated dividends, if any, to the date of such redemption. If less than all

the shares of one series of preference stock is to be redeemed, the shares to be

redeemed shall be selected ratably or by lot, in such manner as may be

prescribed by resolution of the board of directors, by an independent bank or

trust company selected for that purpose by the board of directors. Notice of

such redemption shall be mailed to each holder of redeemable shares being

called, not less than twenty (20) nor more than fifty (50) days before the date

fixed for redemption, at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books

of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. Such notice of redemption of

such shares shall set forth the series or part thereof to be redeemed, the date

fixed for redemption, the redemption price, and the place at which the

shareholders may obtain payment of the redemption price upon surrender of their

respective share certificates. From and after the date fixed in any such notice

as the date of redemption, unless default shall be made by the Corporation in

providing funds sufficient for such redemption at the time and place specified

for the payment thereof pursuant to said notice, all dividends on the shares so

redeemed shall cease to accrue, and all rights of the holders of such shares as

shareholders of the Corporation, except only the right to receive the redemption

funds to which they are entitled, shall cease and determine.



         The Corporation may, on or prior to the date fixed for any redemption,

deposit with any bank or trust company in the State of Texas, or any bank or

trust company in the United States duly appointed and acting as a transfer agent

of the Corporation, as a trust fund, a sum sufficient to redeem shares called

for redemption, with irrevocable instructions and authority to such bank or



                                       4

<PAGE>



trust company to give or complete the notice of redemption thereof and to pay,

on or after the date fixed for such redemption, to the respective holders of

shares, as evidenced by a list of holders of such shares certified by the

Corporation by its President or a Vice President and by its Secretary or an

Assistant Secretary, the redemption price upon the surrender of their respective

share certificates. Thereafter, from and after the date fixed for redemption,

such shares shall be deemed to be redeemed and dividends thereon shall cease to

accrue after such date fixed for redemption. Such deposit shall be deemed to

constitute full payment of such shares to their holders. Thereafter, from and

after the date fixed for redemption, such shares shall no longer be deemed to be

outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect

to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the right to

receive from the bank or trust company payment, without interest, of the

redemption price of such shares plus the amount of unpaid accumulated dividends

upon the surrender of their respective certificates therefor, and any right to

convert such shares which may exist. In case the holders of such shares shall

not, within six (6) years after such deposit, claim the amount deposited for

redemption thereof, such bank or trust company shall upon demand pay over to the

Corporation the balance of such amount so deposited, together with any interest

accrued thereon, which shall become the property of the Corporation, and such

bank or trust company shall thereupon be relieved of all responsibility to the

holders thereof.



         Nothing contained in this Section 4 shall limit the right of the

Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire shares of the preference stock to

the extent permitted by law.



         Shares of preference stock of the Corporation redeemed or purchased by

the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued

shares of preference stock without designation, and may from time to time be

reissued as provided in Section I of this Division A. All such redemptions and

purchases of preference stock of the Corporation shall be effected in accordance

with the laws of the State of Texas governing redemption or purchase or

redeemable shares.



         5. Voting Rights. The holders of the preference stock shall not be

entitled to vote except (a) as expressly conferred in Article VII hereof, or (b)

as may from time to time be mandatorily provided by the laws of Texas, or (c)

for the election of one-third (adjusted to the nearest whole number) of the

board of directors or two directors, whichever is greater, when and as dividends

on any of the outstanding preference stock shall be in default in an amount

equivalent to four (4) full quarterly dividends and thereafter until no

dividends on any preference stock shall be in default or until dividends on any

of the outstanding preference stock shall be in default in an amount equivalent

to eight (8) full quarterly dividends, whichever event shall first occur, or (d)

for the election of the smallest number of directors necessary so that a

majority of the full board shall have been elected by the holders of the

preference stock when and as dividends on any of the outstanding preference

stock shall be in default in an amount equivalent to eight (8) full quarterly

dividends, and thereafter until no dividends on any preference stock shall be in

default.



         The terms of office of all persons who may be directors of the

Corporation at any time when a right to elect members of the board of directors

shall accrue to the holders of the preference stock shall terminate upon the

election of their successors, except that if the holders of the common stock



                                       5

<PAGE>



shall not have elected the remaining directors of the Corporation, then, and

only in that event, the directors of the Corporation in office just prior to the

right of the holders of preference stock to elect the members of the board of

directors shall elect the remaining directors of the Corporation. Thereafter,

during the continuance of any right of the holders of preference stock to elect

the members of the board of directors, as provided above, the remaining

directors, whether elected by directors, as aforesaid, or whether originally or

later elected by holders of the common stock, shall continue in office until

their successors are elected by holders of the common stock and shall qualify.

The term of office of the directors so elected by the holders of the preference

stock, voting separately as a class, and of the directors elected by the holders

of the common stock, voting separately as a class, or elected by directors, as

aforesaid, shall be until the right of the holders of the preference stock to

elect directors shall terminate, as provided above, and until their successors

shall have been elected and shall have qualified.



         Upon the termination of the right of the holders of the preference

stock to elect members of the board of directors, as provided above, the voting

power of the holders of the preference stock and the holders of the common stock

shall revert to the status existing before the first dividend payment date on

which dividends on any of the preference stock were not paid in full, but always

subject to the same provisions for vesting such right in the holders of the

preference stock in case of further like default or defaults in the payment of

dividends thereon. Upon termination of any such voting right upon payment of all

accumulated and defaulted dividends on the preference stock, the terms of office

of all persons who have been elected directors of the Corporation by vote of the

holders of the preference stock as a class, pursuant to such voting right, shall

terminate as hereinabove provided, and the resulting vacancies shall be filled

by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors.



         In case of any vacancy in the office of a director occurring among the

directors elected by the holders of the preference stock, voting as a class, the

remaining directors elected by the holders of the preference stock, by

affirmative vote of a majority thereof, or the remaining director so elected if

there be but one, may elect a successor or successors to hold office for the

unexpired term or terms of the director or directors whose place or places shall

be vacant. In case of any vacancy in the office of a director occurring among

the directors elected by the holders of the common stock, voting separately as a

class, or elected by directors, as aforesaid, the remaining directors so

elected, by affirmative vote of a majority thereof, or the remaining director so

elected if there be but one, may elect a successor or successors to hold office

for the unexpired term or terms of the director or directors whose place or

places shall be vacant.



         Whenever dividends on the preference stock shall be in default, as

provided in this Section 5, it shall be the duty of the President, a Vice

President or the Secretary of the Corporation, or in the event of their failure

to do so within twenty (20) days of such default, the privilege is granted any

holder of preference stock who shall first demand the right so to do by written

notice to the Corporation, forthwith to cause notice to be given to the holders

of the preference stock and to the holders of the common stock of a meeting to

be held at such time as the Corporation's officers, or such holder of preference

stock, as the case may be, may fix, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty

(60) days after the accrual of such privilege, for the purpose of electing

directors. Each holder of record of preference stock, or his legal

representative, shall be entitled at such meeting to one vote for each share of

preference stock standing in his name on the books of the Corporation. At each



                                       6

<PAGE>



meeting of shareholders held for such purpose, the presence in person or by

proxy of the holders of a majority of the common stock shall be required to

constitute a quorum of the common stock for the election of directors, and the

presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the preference

stock shall be required to constitute a quorum of the preference stock for the

election of directors; provided, however, that the absence of a quorum of the

holders of stock of either the preference stock or the common stock shall not

prevent the election at any such meeting or adjournment thereof of directors by

such other class, if the necessary quorum of the holders of stock of such other

class is present in person or by proxy at such meeting or any adjournment

thereof, and the directors so elected and qualified shall constitute the board

of directors with a majority of the directors so elected and qualified

constituting a quorum for meetings of the board until such time as the other

class of shareholders shall elect those directors which it has a right to elect;

and provided, further, that in the absence of a quorum of holders of stock of

either class, a majority of the holders of the stock of the class, which lacks a

quorum, who are present in person or by proxy shall have power to adjourn the

election of the directors to be elected by such class from time to time without

notice other than announcement at the meeting, until the requisite quorum of

holders of such class shall be present in person or by proxy, but such

adjournment shall not be made to a date beyond the date for the mailing of the

notice of the next annual meeting of the Corporation or special meeting in lieu

thereof.



         6. Restrictions on Certain Corporation Action. So long as any shares of

any series of the preference stock shall remain outstanding, the Corporation

shall not, without the authorization of the holders of not less than two-thirds

of the issued and outstanding shares of preference stock, voting as a class at a

meeting called for the purpose of approving such action:



                  (a) Create, authorize or issue any class stock ranking prior

         to the preference stock in respect to dividends or liquidation rights

         (other than stock issuable upon conversion of obligations or

         securities, or upon the exercise of warrants, rights or options to

         purchase, authorized pursuant to (b) below);



                  (b) Create, authorize or issue any obligation or security

         convertible into, or any warrants, rights or options to purchase or

         subscribe to, any stock ranking prior to the preference stock in

         respect to dividends or liquidation rights;



                  (c) Materially alter the provisions hereof relative to the

         preference stock, or any series thereof, which would change the express

         terms and provisions of such stock, including any change in the

         provisions of Section 5 and 6 of this Division A; provided, however,

         that if such material change appertains to outstanding shares of one or

         more, but not all, of such series, then for the purposes of this

         Section 6 such change shall be deemed to be authorized if holders of

         two-thirds of the shares affected shall vote favorably with respect

         thereto.

                     DIVISION B-DESCRIPTION OF ISSUED SERIES



                             DIVISION C-COMMON STOCK



         Subject to the rights expressly conferred upon the holders of

preference stock, under prescribed conditions, by this Article VI, and

subordinate thereto, the holders of the common stock alone shall:



                  1. Receive all dividends declared by the board of directors.



                  2. Receive all assets of the Corporation available for

         distribution to its shareholders in the event of any liquidation,

         dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. The board of directors,

         by vote of a majority of the members thereof, may distribute in kind to

         the holders of the common stock such remaining assets of the

         Corporation, or may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any

         of the remaining property and assets of the Corporation to any other

         corporation or other purchaser and receive payment therefor wholly or

         partially in cash or property or stock or obligations of such

         purchaser, and may sell all or any part of the consideration received

         therefor and distribute the same or the proceeds thereof to the holders

         of the common stock.



                  3. Possess exclusively full voting power for the election of

         directors and for all other purposes, except as set forth in Division

         A-5 of this Section VI.



                                  ARTICLE VII.



         The holders of a majority of the aggregate number of shares of the

outstanding stock of the Corporation, entitled to vote upon any matter to be

acted upon, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the

transaction of business at any meeting of shareholders, but less than a quorum

shall have power to adjourn. At all meetings of the shareholders, each

shareholder entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote for each share of

stock held by him and recorded in his name on the record date for such meeting,

and may vote and otherwise act either in person or by proxy, except that in all

elections for directors every shareholder entitled to vote shall have the right

to vote in person or by proxy the number of shares owned by him for as many

persons as there are directors to be elected, or to cumulate such shares and

give one candidate as many votes as the number of directors multiplied by the

number of his shares shall equal, or to distribute them on the same principle

among as many candidates as he shall think fit. Any shareholder who intends to

cumulate his votes shall give written notice of such intention to the secretary

of the Corporation on or before the day preceding the election at which such

shareholder intends to cumulate his votes. Unless otherwise provided by statute

or by the articles of incorporation of the Corporation, when a quorum is present

at any meeting, a majority of the stock represented thereat shall decide any

question before such meeting.

<PAGE>



                                  ARTICLE VIII.



         Upon any issue for money or other consideration of any stock, or any

securities convertible into stock, of any class whatsoever of the Corporation

that may be authorized from time to time, no holder of stock of any class shall

have any preemptive or other right to subscribe for, purchase or receive any

proportionate or other share of stock or securities so issued, but the board of

directors may dispose of all or any portion of such stock or securities as and

when it may determine free of any such rights, whether by offering the same to

shareholders or by sale or other disposition as said board may deem advisable.

The consideration received by the Corporation from the issuance and sale of any

additional shares of common stock without par value shall be entered in the

capital stock account.



         ARTICLE IX.



         The Corporation shall reimburse or indemnify any former, present or

future director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or any person who may

have served at its request as a director, officer or employee of another

corporation, or any former, present or future director, officer or employee of

the Corporation who shall have served or shall be serving as an administrator,

agent or fiduciary for the Corporation or for another corporation at the request

of the Corporation (and his heirs, executors and administrators) for or against

all expenses and liabilities incurred by him or them, or imposed on him or them,

including, but not limited to, judgments, settlements, court costs and

attorneys' fees, in connection with, or arising out of, the defense of any

action, suit or proceeding in which he may be involved by reason of his being or

having been such director, officer or employee, except with respect to matters

as to which he shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding to be liable

because he did not act in good faith, or because of dishonesty or conflict of

interest in the performance of his duty.



         No former, present or future director, officer or employee of the

Corporation (or his heirs, executors and administrators) shall be liable for any

act, omission, step or conduct taken or had in good faith, which is required,

authorized or approved by an order or orders issued pursuant to the Public

Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, or any other federal

or state statute regulating the Corporation or its subsidiaries, or any

amendments to any thereof. In any action, suit or proceeding based on any act,

omission, step or conduct, as in this paragraph described, the provisions hereof

shall be brought to the attention of the court. In the event that the foregoing

provisions of this paragraph are found by the court not to constitute a valid

defense, each such director, officer or employee (and his heirs, executors and

administrators) shall be reimbursed for, or indemnified against, all expenses

and liabilities incurred by him or them, or imposed on him or them, including,

but not limited to, judgments, settlements, court costs and attorneys' fees, in

connection with, or arising out of, any such action, suit or proceeding based on

any act, omission, step or conduct taken or had in good faith as in this

paragraph described.



         The foregoing rights shall not be exclusive of other rights to which

any such director, officer or employee (or his heirs, executors and

administrators) may otherwise be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of

shareholders or otherwise, and shall be available whether or not the director,

officer or employee continues to be a director, officer or employee at the time



                                       9

<PAGE>



of incurring such expenses and liabilities. In furtherance, and not in

limitation of the foregoing provisions of this Article IX, the Corporation may

indemnify and may insure any such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the

Texas Business Corporation Act, as amended from time to time, or the laws of the

State of Texas, as in effect from time to time.



                                   ARTICLE X.



         A director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or

its shareholders for monetary damages for any act or omission in the director's

capacity as a director, except that this provision does not eliminate or limit

the liability of a director to the extent the director is found liable for:



                  (a) a breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the

         Corporation or its shareholders;



                  (b) an act or omission not in good faith that constitutes a

         breach of duty of the director to the Corporation or an act or omission

         that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;



                  (c) a transaction from which the director received an improper

         benefit, whether or not the benefit resulted from an action taken

         within the scope of the director's office; or



                  (d)      an act or omission for which the liability of the

         director is expressly provided for by an applicable statute.



         If the laws of the State of Texas are amended to authorize action

further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the

liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the

fullest extent permitted by such laws as so amended. Any repeal or modification

of this Article X shall not adversely affect any right of protection of a

director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

dispose of any (but less than all or substantially all) of its property

essential to the conduct of its corporate business and purposes, pursuant to the

affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors and the holders of a

majority in aggregate number of the shares of the stock of the Corporation then

outstanding and entitled to vote, for such consideration and upon such terms as

may be approved by a majority of the board of directors and the holders of a

majority in aggregate number of shares of stock of the Corporation then

         ARTICLE XII.



         Pursuant to the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders

of a majority in aggregate number of the shares of stock of the Corporation then

outstanding and entitled to vote (1) any or every statute of the State of Texas

hereafter enacted, whereby the rights, powers or privileges of the Corporation

are or may be increased, diminished or in any way affected, or whereby the

rights, powers or privileges of the shareholders of corporations organized under

the law under which the Corporation is organized are increased, diminished or in

any way affected, or whereby effect is given to the action taken by any part

less than all of the shareholders of any such corporation shall apply to the

Corporation, and shall be binding upon not only the Corporation but upon every

shareholder thereof, to the same extent as if such statute had been in force at

the date of the making and filing of the charter of the Corporation and/or (2)

amendments to these articles of incorporation authorized at the time of the

making of such amendments by the laws of the State of Texas may be made, except

in cases where a different vote or consent is required by statute or by the

provisions of these articles of incorporation.



                                  ARTICLE XIII.



         The bylaws of the Corporation may be altered, changed or amended as

provided by statute, or at any meeting of the board of directors by affirmative

vote of a majority of all of the directors, if notice of the proposed change has

been delivered or mailed to the directors at least ten days before the meeting;

provided that the board of directors shall not make or alter any bylaw fixing

their number, qualifications, classification, or term of office.



         ARTICLE XIV.



         The Corporation has heretofore complied with the requirements of law as

to the initial minimum capital requirements without which it could not commence

business under the Texas Business Corporation Act.

by, or under the direction of, the Board. The number of directors which shall

and shall be determined by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire

Board. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Article IV of this Certificate

of Incorporation relating to additional directors elected by the holders of

one or more series of Preferred Stock, no decrease in the number of directors

constituting the Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.



B. All directors of the Corporation shall be of one class and shall be elected

annually. Each director shall serve for a term ending at the next following

annual meeting of stockholders, and until such directors successor shall have

been duly elected and qualified, subject to his earlier death,

C. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of

Article IV relating to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred

Stock to elect additional directors, and subject to the provisions hereof,

newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized

successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, subject to his earlier

death, disqualification, resignation or removal.



D. During any period when the holders of any series of Preferred Stock have

the right to elect additional directors as provided for or fixed pursuant to

the provisions of Article IV, then upon commencement and for the duration of

the period during which such right continues (i) the then otherwise total

authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be

increased by such specified number of directors, and the holders of such

Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so

provided for or fixed pursuant to said provisions, and (ii) each such

additional director shall serve until such directors successor shall have

as otherwise provided by the Board in the resolution or resolutions

establishing such series, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred

Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested of such

right pursuant to the provisions of such stock, the terms of office of all

such additional directors elected by the holders of such stock, or elected to

fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or

removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate and the total

and authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be reduced

and procedures of the Bylaws of the Corporation, including any limitations on

the stockholders ability to request a special meeting set forth in the Bylaws

of the Corporation. Special meetings of stockholders may not be called by any

other person or persons or in any other manner. Elections of directors need

B. In addition to the powers conferred on the Board by this Certificate of

Incorporation and by the General Corporation Law, and without limiting the

without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Bylaws relating to (i)

regulation of the procedure for submission by stockholders of nominations of

persons to be elected to the Board, (ii) regulation of the attendance at

annual or special meetings of the stockholders of persons other than holders

of record or their proxies, (iii) regulation of the manner in which, and the

ARTICLE VIII



Limitation of Liability



A director of this Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its

stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,

except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is

not permitted under the General Corporation Law as the same exists or may

hereafter be amended. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph

shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the

Corporation existing hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring

prior to such repeal or modification.



ARTICLE IX



Executive Committee



The Board, pursuant to the Bylaws of the Corporation or by resolution passed

by a majority of the then-authorized number of directors, may designate any of

their number to constitute an Executive Committee, which Executive Committee,

to the fullest extent permitted by law and provided for in said resolution or

in the Bylaws of the Corporation, shall have and may exercise all of the

powers of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the

Corporation, and shall have power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to

ARTICLE X



Indemnification



A. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is

threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,

suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative

(other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the

fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the

Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a

director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,

joint venture or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys

fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably

incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he

acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not

opposed to the best interest of the Corporation and, with respect to any

criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his

conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by

judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or

its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did

not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or

not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation and with respect to any

criminal action or proceeding had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct

was unlawful.



7



* * *



B. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is

threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action

or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its

favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or

agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the

Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation,

partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses

(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in

connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit, if he acted

in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed

to the best interest of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall

be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall

have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the

extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall

determine, upon application, that despite the adjudication of liability, but

in the view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and

reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem

proper.



C. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or

proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition

of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on

behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it

shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by

the Corporation as authorized herein.



D. The Corporation may purchase (upon resolution duly adopted by the board of

directors) and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a

director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving

at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise

against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such

capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation

would have the power to indemnify him against such liability.



E. To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the

Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any

action, suit, or proceeding referred to herein or in defense of any claim,

issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including

attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection

therewith.



F. Every such person shall be entitled, without demand by him upon the

Corporation or any action by the Corporation, to enforce his right to such

indemnity in an action at law against the Corporation. The right of

indemnification and advancement of expenses hereinabove provided shall not be

deemed exclusive of any rights to which any such person may now or hereafter

be otherwise entitled and specifically, without limiting the generality of the

foregoing, shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights pursuant to statute or

otherwise, of any such person in any such action, suit or proceeding to have

assessed or allowed in his favor against the Corporation or otherwise, his

costs and expenses incurred therein or in connection therewith or any part

thereof.

                               WGL HOLDINGS, INC.



     The undersigned, being an individual, does hereby act as incorporator in

adopting the following Articles of Incorporation for the purpose of organizing a

corporation authorized by law to issue shares, pursuant to the provisions of the

Virginia Stock Corporation Act, Chapter 9 of Title 13.1 of the Code of Virginia.



     FIRST:  The name of the Corporation is WGL Holdings, Inc. (the

""Corporation"").



     SECOND:  The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or

activity not required to be specifically stated in these Articles of

Incorporation (""Articles"") for which corporations may be organized under the

laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.



     THIRD:  (a) The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation is

authorized to issue and the par value per share are as follows:



<TABLE>

<CAPTION>

  CLASS    NUMBER OF SHARES    PAR VALUE

  -----    ----------------   ------------

<S>        <C>                <C>

Common       120,000,000      No Par Value

Preferred      3,000,000      No Par Value

</TABLE>



          (b) The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the authority

     to fix, in whole or in part, the preferences, limitations and relative

     rights, within the limits set by law, of (i) any class of shares before the

     issuance of any shares of that class, or (ii) one or more series within a

     class before the issuance of any shares of that series.



          (c) The holders of common stock, to the exclusion of any other class

     of stock of the Corporation, have sole and full power to vote for the

     election of directors and for all other purposes without limitation except

     only (i) as otherwise expressly provided in the serial designation of any

     series of preferred stock, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in these

     Articles or (iii) as otherwise expressly provided by the then existing laws

     of the Commonwealth of Virginia. In the election of directors and in all

     other matters as to which the shareholders shall be entitled to vote, the

     holders of common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share of

     common stock held by them. The outstanding shares of common stock, upon

     dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, entitle their

     holders to share, pro rata, based on the number of shares owned, in the

     Corporation's assets remaining after payment or provisions for payment of

     all debts and liabilities of the Corporation, and after provisions for the

     outstanding shares of any class of stock or other security having senior

     liquidation rights to the common stock.



          (d) No holder of shares of stock of any class of the Corporation will

     have any preemptive or preferential right of subscription to any shares of

     any class of stock of the Corporation, whether now or hereafter authorized,

     or to any obligations of the Corporation convertible into stock of the

     Corporation, issued or sold, nor any right of subscription to any thereof.



     FOURTH:  Subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock

to elect directors under specified circumstances:



          (a) The number of directors of the Corporation shall consist of one or

     more individuals as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the

     Board of Directors of the Corporation.



          (b) Any action required or permitted by these Articles of

     Incorporation to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken by a duly

     authorized committee of the Board of Directors, except as otherwise

     required by law.



                                       B-1

<PAGE>   64



     FIFTH:  No director or officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the

Corporation or its shareholders for any monetary damages for any action taken or

any failure to take any action as a director or officer; provided, however, that

nothing herein shall be deemed to eliminate or limit any liability which may not

be so eliminated or limited under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, as

in effect at the effective date of these Articles of Incorporation or as

thereafter amended. No amendment, modification or repeal of this ARTICLE FIFTH

shall eliminate or limit the protection afforded to a officer or director with

respect to any act or omission occurring before the effective date hereof.



     SIXTH:  (a) The Corporation shall, to the maximum extent permitted by

applicable law, as from time to time in effect, indemnify any person who was, is

or is threatened to be named as a defendant or respondent in or otherwise

involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,

whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or

informal, including without limitation any such action, suit or proceeding by or

in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor (any such

action, suit or proceeding being herein called a ""Proceeding""), because he or

she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or because he or she,

while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the

Corporation's request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or

agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture,

trust, employee benefit plan or any other entity or enterprise, against any and

all judgments, settlements, penalties, fines, including any excise tax assessed

with respect to an employee benefit plan, and/or reasonable expenses (including

counsel fees) incurred with respect to a Proceeding or any appeal therein.



          (b) The Corporation shall pay any such expenses incurred by a director

     or officer, or former director or officer, of the Corporation in connection

     with any such Proceeding in advance of the final disposition thereof upon

     receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such

     advances to the extent of the amount to which such person shall ultimately

     be determined not to be entitled and upon satisfaction of such other

     conditions as may be required by applicable law.



          (c) The Corporation, by resolution of the Board of Directors, may

     extend the benefits of this Article SIXTH to current and/or former

     employees, agents and other representatives of the Corporation (each person

     entitled to benefits under this Article SIXTH being hereinafter sometimes

     called an ""Indemnified Person"").



          (d) All rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses

     granted under or pursuant to this Article SIXTH shall be deemed to arise

     out of a contract between the Corporation and each person who is an

     Indemnified Person at any time while this Article SIXTH is in effect and

     may be evidenced by a separate contract between the Corporation and each

     Indemnified Person; and such rights shall be effective in respect of all

     Proceedings commenced after the effective date of these Articles of

     Incorporation, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or

     after such date. No amendment, modification or repeal of this Article SIXTH

     shall affect any rights or obligations theretofore existing.



          (e) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of,

     or insure or cause to be insured, any person who is an Indemnified Person

     against any liability asserted against or incurred by him or her in any

     capacity in respect of which he or she is an Indemnified Person, or arising

     out of his or her status in such capacity, whether or not the Corporation

     would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under

     this Article SIXTH. As used in this Section ""insurance"" includes

     retrospectively rated and self-insured programs; provided, however that no

     such program shall provide coverage for directors and officers which is

     prohibited by applicable law. The Corporation's indemnity of any person who

     is an Indemnified Person shall be reduced by any amounts such person may

     collect with respect to such liability (1) under any policy of insurance

     purchased and



                                       B-2

<PAGE>   65



     maintained on his or her behalf by the Corporation or (2) from any other

     entity or enterprise served by such person.



          (f) The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses

     and all other benefits provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article

     SIXTH shall continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in the capacity

     in respect of which such person was an Indemnified Person and shall inure

     to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.



          (g) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or

     granted pursuant to, this Article SIXTH shall not be deemed exclusive of

     any other rights to which any Indemnified Person may be entitled under any

     statute or court order or any Bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or

     disinterested directors or otherwise.



          (h) The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make,

     alter, amend and repeal such procedural rules and regulations relating to

     indemnification and the advancement of expenses as it, in its discretion,

     may deem necessary or expedient in order to carry out the purposes of this

     Article SIXTH, such rules and regulations, if any, to be set forth in the

     Bylaws of the Corporation or in a resolution of the Board of Directors.

           Stock acquired by it within the two-year period immediately prior to

           the first public announcement of the proposed Business Combination

           became an Interested Shareholder (the Determination Date), whichever

           is higher; or



                (c) the price per share equal to the Fair Market Value per share

           of the Corporation's Common Stock determined pursuant to (b) above

           brokerage commissions, transfer taxes, and soliciting dealers' fees)

           paid by the Interested Shareholder for any shares of Common Stock

           acquired by it within the two-year period immediately prior to the

           Announcement Date to the Fair Market Value per share of common stock

           on the first day in such two-year period during which the Interested

           Shareholder acquired any shares of Common Stock.



          (2) PREFERRED STOCK.  As of the date of the consummation of the

     Business Combination, the aggregate amount of the cash and the Fair Market

     Value of consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders

     of shares of any other class of outstanding Voting Stock shall be at least

     equal to the highest of the following (it being intended that this

     Paragraph E-2a(2) must be satisfied with respect to every class of

     outstanding Voting Stock whether or not the Interested Shareholder has

           holders of shares of such class of Voting Stock are entitled in the

           event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or

           winding up of the Corporation;



                (c) the Fair Market Value per share of such class of Voting

           Stock on the Announcement Date or on the Determination Date,

           whichever is higher; or



                (d) the price per share equal to the Fair Market Value per share

           of such class of Voting Stock determined pursuant to (c) above

           multiplied by the ratio of the highest per-share price (including any

           brokerage commissions, transfer taxes, and soliciting dealers' fees)

           paid by the Interested Shareholder for any shares of such class of

           Voting Stock acquired by it within the two-year period immediately

           prior to the Announcement Date to the Fair Market Value per share of

           such class of Voting Stock on the first day in such two-year period

           during which the Interested Shareholder acquired any shares of such

           class of Voting Stock.

<PAGE>   69



        same form as the Interested Shareholder has previously paid for shares

        of such class of Voting Stock. If the Interested Shareholder has paid

        for shares of any class of Voting Stock with varying forms of

        consideration, the form of consideration for such class of Voting Stock

        shall be either in cash or in the same form used to acquire the largest

        number of shares of such class of Voting Stock previously acquired by

        it.



             (2) CHANGES IN CORPORATION DIVIDENDS.  After the Interested

        Shareholder has become an Interested Shareholder and prior to the

        consummation of a Business Combination,



                (a) the Corporation shall have continued to declare and pay at

           the regular date therefor the full quarterly dividends (whether or

           not cumulative) on the outstanding Preferred Stock, except as

           otherwise approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors; and



                (b) the Corporation shall have continued to declare and pay at

           the regular date the established dividends on the Common Stock

           (except as necessary to reflect any subdivision of the Common Stock

           and as otherwise approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors)

           and the Corporation shall have declared and paid an increase in such

           established rate of dividends as necessary to reflect any

           reclassification (including any reverse stock split),

           recapitalization, reorganization, or any similar transaction which

           has the effect of reducing the number of outstanding shares of Common

           Stock, except as otherwise approved by a majority of the Continuing

           Directors.



             (3) NO CHANGES IN STOCK INTERESTS.  The Interested Shareholder

        shall not have become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of

        Voting Stock except as part of the transaction which results in such

        Interested Shareholder becoming an Interested Shareholder.



             (4) FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH THE CORPORATION.  After becoming an

        Interested Shareholder, the Interested Shareholder shall not have

        received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as

        a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges, or other

        financial assistance, or any tax credits or other tax advantages

        provided by the Corporation, whether in anticipation of, or in

        connection with, such Business Combination or otherwise.

        Interested Shareholder shall have mailed to shareholders of the

        Corporation at least 30 days prior to the consummation of such Business

        otherwise) describing the proposed Business Combination and complying

        with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the

        rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing

        such Act, rules, or regulations).



     F. NO EFFECT ON FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS OF INTERESTED SHAREHOLDERS.  Nothing

contained in this Article SEVENTH shall be construed to relieve any Interested

Shareholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.

         12.2    Indemnification Rights of Directors and Officers.  The

Corporation shall indemnify its Directors and Officers to the full extent not

prohibited by applicable law now or hereafter in force against liability

arising out of a Proceeding to which such individual was made a Party because

the individual is or was a Director or an Officer.  However, such indemnity

shall not apply on account of:



         (a)     Acts or omissions of a Director or Officer finally adjudged to

                 be intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;



         (b)     Conduct of a Director or Officer finally adjudged to be in

                 violation of Section 23B.09.3 10 of the Act relating to

                 distributions by the Corporation; or



         (c)     Any transaction with respect to which it was finally adjudged

                 that such Director or Officer personally received a benefit in

                 money, property, or services to which the Director or Officer

                 was not legally entitled.



Subject to the foregoing, it is specifically intended that Proceedings covered

by indemnification shall include Proceedings brought by the Corporation

(including derivative actions) Proceedings by government entities and

governmental officials or other third party actions.



         12.3    Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation.

The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors from time to time,

provide indemnification and pay Expenses in advance of the final disposition of

a Proceeding to Employees and Agents of the Corporation who are not also

Directors, in each case to the same extent as to a Director with



                                      -5-

<PAGE>   6



respect to the indemnification and advancement of Expenses pursuant to rights

granted under, or provided by, the Act or otherwise.



         12.4    Partial Indemnification.  If an Indemnitee is entitled to

indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of Expenses,

liabilities, or losses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in an

investigation, defense, appeal or settlement but not, however, for the total

amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the

portion of such Expenses, liabilities or losses to which Indemnitee is

entitled.



         12.5    Procedure for Seeking Indemnification and/or Advancement of

Expenses.  The following procedures shall apply in the absence of (or at the

option of the Indemnitee, in lieu thereof), specific procedures otherwise

applicable to an Indemnitee pursuant to a contract, trust agreement, or general

or specific action of the Board of Directors:



                 12.5.1   NOTIFICATION AND DEFENSE OF CLAIM.  Indemnitee shall

         promptly notify the Corporation in writing of any proceeding for which

         indemnification could be sought under this Article.  In addition,

         Indemnitee shall give the Corporation such information and cooperation

         as it may reasonably require and as shall be within Indemnitee's

         power.



         With respect to any such proceeding as to which Indemnitee has

         notified the Corporation:



                 (a)      The Corporation will be entitled to participate

                          therein at its own expense; and



                 (b)      Except as otherwise provided below, to the extent

                          that it may wish, the Corporation, jointly with any

                          other indemnifying party similarly notified, will be

                          entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel

                          satisfactory to Indemnitee.  Indemnitee's consent to

                          such counsel may not be unreasonably withheld.



                 After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its

         election to assume the defense, the Corporation will not be liable to

         Indemnitee under this Article for any legal or other Expenses

         subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such defense.

         However, Indemnitee shall continue to have the right to employ its

         counsel in such proceeding, at Indemnitee's expense; and if:



                          (i)     The employment of counsel by Indemnitee has

                                  been authorized by the Corporation;



                          (ii)    Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded

                                  that there may be a conflict of interest

                                  between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the

                                  conduct of such defense; or



                                      -6-

<PAGE>   7



                          (iii)   The Corporation shall not in fact have

                                  employed counsel to assume the defense of 

                                  such proceeding,



the fees and Expenses of Indemnitee's counsel shall be at the expense of the 

Corporation.



                 The Corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of

         any proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Corporation or as to

         which Indemnitee shall reasonably have made the conclusion that a

         conflict of interest may exist between the Corporation and the

         Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense.



                 12.5.2   INFORMATION TO BE SUBMITTED AND METHOD OF

         DETERMINATION AND AUTHORIZATION OF INDEMNIFICATION.  For the purpose

         of pursuing rights to indemnification under this Article, the

         Indemnitee shall submit to the Board a sworn statement requesting

         indemnification and reasonable evidence of all amounts for which such

         indemnification is requested (together, the sworn statement and the

         evidence constitute an ""Indemnification Statement"").



                 Submission of an Indemnification Statement to the Board shall

         create a presumption that the Indemnitee is entitled to

         indemnification hereunder, and the Corporation shall, within sixty

         (60) calendar days thereafter, make the payments requested in the

         Indemnification Statement to or for the benefit of the Indemnitee,

         unless: (1) within such sixty (60) calendar day period it shall be

         determined by the Corporation that the Indemnitee is not entitled to

         indemnification under this Article; (2) such determination shall be

         based upon clear and convincing evidence (sufficient to rebut the

         foregoing presumption); and (3) the Indemnitee shall receive notice in

         writing of such determination, which notice shall disclose with

         particularity the evidence upon which the determination is based.



                 The foregoing determination may be made: (1) by the Board of

         Directors by majority vote of a quorum of Directors who are not at the

         time parties to the proceedings; (2) if a quorum cannot be obtained,

         by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the Board of

         Directors (in which designation Directors who are parties may

         participate) consisting solely of two (2) or more Directors not at the

         time parties to the proceeding; (3) by special legal counsel; or (4)

         by the shareholders as provided by Section 23B.08.550 of the Act.



                 Any determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to

         indemnification, and any failure to make the payments requested in the

         Indemnification Statement, shall be subject to judicial review by any

         court of competent jurisdiction.



                 12.5.3   SPECIAL PROCEDURE REGARDING ADVANCE FOR EXPENSES.  An

         Indemnitee seeking payment of Expenses in advance of a final

         disposition of the proceeding must furnish the Corporation, as part of

         the Indemnification Statement:



                                      -7-

<PAGE>   8



                          (a)     A written affirmation of the Indemnitee's

                                  good faith belief that the Indemnitee has met

                                  the standard of conduct required to be

                                  eligible for indemnification; and



                          (b)     A written undertaking, constituting an

                                  unlimited general obligation of the

                                  Indemnitee, to repay the advance if it is

                                  ultimately determined that the Indemnitee did

                                  not meet the required standard of conduct.



                 Upon satisfaction of the foregoing the Indemnitee shall have a

contractual right to the payment of such Expenses.



                 12.5.4   SETTLEMENT.  The Corporation is not liable to

         indemnify Indemnitee for any amounts paid in settlement of any

         proceeding without the Corporation's written consent.  The Corporation

         shall not settle any proceeding in any manner which would impose any

         penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's written

         consent.  Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee may unreasonably

         withhold its consent to a proposed settlement.



         12.6.   Contract and Related Rights.



                 12.6.1   CONTRACT RIGHTS.  The right of an Indemnitee to

         indemnification and advancement of Expenses is a contract right upon

         which the Indemnitee shall be presumed to have relied in determining

         to serve or to continue to serve in his or her capacity with the

         Corporation.  Such right shall continue as long as the Indemnitee

         shall be subject to any possible proceeding.  Any amendment to or

         repeal of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or

         protection of an Indemnitee with respect to any acts or omissions of

         such Indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.



                 12.6.2   OPTIONAL INSURANCE, CONTRACTS, AND FUNDING.  The

         Corporation may:



                          (a)     Maintain insurance, at its expense, to

                                  protect itself and any Indemnitee against any

                                  liability, whether or not the Corporation

                                  would have power to indemnify the individual

                                  against the same liability under Section

                                  23B.08.5 10 or .520 of the Act;



                          (b)     Enter into contracts with any Indemnitee in

                                  furtherance of this Article and consistent

                                  with the Act; and



                          (c)     Create a trust fund, grant a security

                                  interest, or use other means (including

                                  without limitation a letter of credit) to

                                  ensure the



                                      -8-

<PAGE>   9



                                  payment of such amounts as may be necessary

                                  to effect indemnification as provided in 

                                  this Article.



                 12.6.3   SEVERABILITY.  If any provision or application of

         this Article shall be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this

         Article and its remaining applications shall not be affected thereby,

         and shall continue in full force and effect.



                 12.6.4   RIGHT OF INDEMNITEE TO BRING SUIT.  If (1) a claim

         under this Article for indemnification is not paid in full by the

         Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been

         received by the Corporation; or (2) a claim under this Article for

         advancement of Expenses is not paid in full by the Corporation within

         twenty (20) days after a written claim has been received by the

         Corporation, then the Indemnitee may, but need not, at any time

         thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid

         amount of the claim.  To the extent successful in whole or in part,

         the Indemnitee shall be entitled to also be paid the expense (to be

         proportionately prorated if the Indemnitee is only partially

         successful) of prosecuting such claim.  Neither (1) the failure of the

         Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its shareholders, or

         independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the

         commencement of such proceeding that indemnification or reimbursement

         or advancement of Expenses to the Indemnitee is proper in the

         circumstances; nor (2) an actual determination by the Corporation

         (including its Board of Directors, its shareholders, or independent

         legal counsel that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification

         or to the reimbursement or advancement of Expenses, shall be a defense

         to the proceeding or create a presumption that the Indemnitee is not

         so entitled.



                 12.6.5   NONEXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS.  The right to

         indemnification and the payment of Expenses incurred in defending a

         Proceeding in advance of its final disposition granted in this Article

         shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Indemnitee may

         have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Article

         or the Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested

         directors, or otherwise.  The Corporation shall have the express right

         to grant additional indemnity without seeking further approval or

         satisfaction by the shareholders.  All applicable indemnity provisions

         and any applicable law shall be interpreted and applied so as to

         provide an Indemnitee with the broadest but nonduplicative indemnity

         to which he or she is entitled.



         12.7    Contribution.  If the indemnification provided in Section 12.2

of this Article is not available to be paid to Indemnitee for any reason other

than those set forth in subparagraphs 12.2(a), 12.2(b), and 12.2(c) of Section

12.2 of this Article (for example, because indemnification is held to be

against public policy even though otherwise permitted under Section 12.2) then

in respect of any proceeding in which the Corporation is jointly liable with

Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such proceeding), the Corporation shall

contribute to the amount of loss paid or payable by Indemnitee in such

proportion as is appropriate to reflect:



                                      -9-

<PAGE>   10



                          The relative benefits received by the Corporation on

                          the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand

                          from the transaction from which such proceeding

                          arose, and



                          The relative fault of the Corporation on the one hand

                          and the Indemnitee on the other hand in connection

                          with the events which resulted in such loss, as well

                          as any other relevant equitable consideration.



         The relative benefits received by and fault of the Corporation on the

one hand and the Indemnitee on the other shall be determined by a court of

appropriate jurisdiction (which may be the same court in which the proceeding

took place) with reference to, among other things, the parties' relative

intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent

the circumstances resulting in such loss.  The Corporation agrees that it would

not be just and equitable if a contribution pursuant to this Article was

determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does

not take account of the foregoing equitable considerations.



         12.8    Exceptions. Any other provision herein to the contrary

notwithstanding, the Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms

of these Articles to indemnify or advance Expenses to Indemnitee with respect

to any proceeding.



                 12.8.1   CLAIMS INITIATED BY INDEMNITEE.  Initiated or brought

         voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way of defense, but such

         indemnification or advancement of Expenses may be provided by the

         Corporation in specific cases if the Board of Directors finds it to be

         appropriate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall

         provide indemnification including the advancement of Expenses with

         respect to Proceedings brought to establish or enforce a right to

         indemnification under these Articles or any other statute or law or as

         otherwise required under the statute.



                 12.8.2   LACK OF GOOD FAITH.  Instituted by Indemnitee to

         enforce or interpret this Article, if a court of competent

         jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by

         Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was

         frivolous.



                 12.8.3   INSURED CLAIMS.  For which any of the Expenses or

         liabilities for indemnification is being sought have been paid

         directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under a policy of

         officers' and directors' liability insurance maintained by the

         Corporation.



                 12.8.4   PROHIBITED BY LAW.  If the Corporation is prohibited

         by the Act or other applicable law as then in effect from paying such

         indemnification and/or advancement of Expenses.  For example, the

         Corporation and Indemnitee acknowledge that the Securities and

         Exchange Commission (""SEC"") has taken the position that

         indemnification is not possible for liabilities arising under certain

         federal securities laws.  Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that

         the Corporation has undertaken or may be required in



                                      -10-

<PAGE>   11



         the future to undertake with the SEC to submit the question of

         indemnification to a court in certain circumstances for a

         determination of the Corporation's right to indemnify Indemnitee.



         12.9    Successors and Assigns.  All obligations of the Corporation to

indemnify any Director or Officer shall be binding upon all successors and

assigns of the Corporation (including any transferee of all or substantially

all of its assets and any successor by merger or otherwise by operation of

law).  The Corporation shall not effect any sale of substantially all of its

assets, merger, consolidation, or other reorganization, in which it is not the

surviving entity, unless the surviving entity agrees in writing to assume all

such obligations of the Corporation.



                                  ARTICLE XIII



                  CORPORATION'S ACQUISITION OF ITS OWN SHARES



         The Corporation may purchase, redeem, receive, take or otherwise

acquire, own and hold, sell, lend, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of,

pledge, use and otherwise deal with and in its own shares.  As a specific

modification of Section 23B.06.310 of the Act, pursuant to the authority in

Section 23B.02.020(5)(c) of the Act, to include provisions related to the

management of the business and the regulation of the affairs of the

Corporation, shares of the Corporation's stock acquired by it pursuant to this

Article shall be considered ""Treasury Stock"" and so held by the Corporation.

The shares so acquired by the Corporation shall not be considered as authorized

and unissued but rather as authorized, issued, and held by the Corporation.

The shares, so acquired shall not be regarded as cancelled or as a reduction to

the authorized capital of the Corporation unless specifically so designated by

the Board of Directors in an amendment to these Articles of Incorporation.  The

provisions of this Article do not alter or effect the status of the

Corporation's acquisition of its shares as a ""distribution"" by the Corporation

as defined in Section 23B.01.400(6) of the Act, nor alter or effect the

limitations on distributions by the Corporation as set forth in Section

23B.06.400 of the Act.  Any shares so acquired by the Corporation, unless

otherwise specifically designated by the Board of Directors, at the time of

acquired for such consideration and according to such procedures as established

by the Board of Directors.

Article IV



A. Number of Directors. The authorized number of directors of the Corporation

vote of the majority of the entire Board at any regular or special meeting of

the Board, within any limits prescribed in the By-laws of the Corporation.



B. Vacancies and Removal. Subject to the provisions hereof, newly created

directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of

affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even

though less than a quorum of the Board. Any director elected in accordance

with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full

term of the class, if any, of directors in which the new directorship was

director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any

two or more of them as such holder may see fit.



D. Action Without Meeting by Written Consent. All actions required to be taken

at any annual or special meeting may be taken without a meeting, without prior

outstanding voting stock and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery

to its registered office, its principal place of business, or an officer or

agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of

Article V



In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of

By-laws of the Corporation shall so provide.

without the State of Delaware as the By-laws of the Corporation may provide or

Article VI



A. Exculpation. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same

exists or as may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not

be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary

damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the Delaware

Corporation Law hereafter is amended to further eliminate or limit the

liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation,

in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be

limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended DGCL. Any repeal or

modification of this paragraph by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be

prospective only and shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal

liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal

or modification.



B. Indemnification.



1\. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is

threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit

or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or

otherwise (hereinafter a proceeding), by reason of the fact that he or she

is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while serving as a

director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of

the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another

corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,

including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an

indemnitee), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an

official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other

capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be

indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent

authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but,

in the case of any such amendment, except as may be prohibited by applicable

law, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide

broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all

expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines,

ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably

incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such

indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a

director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the

indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that,

except as provided in Section B3 of this Article VI with respect to

proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall

indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part

thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part

thereof) was authorized by the Board.

* * *



#####  



2\. Right to Advancement of Expenses. The right to indemnification conferred

in Section B1 shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the

expenses incurred in defending any proceeding for which such right to

indemnification is applicable in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter

an advancement of expenses); provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires,

an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as

a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or

is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an

employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of

an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking), by or on behalf of such

indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be

determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to

appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication) that such indemnitee is not

entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section or otherwise.



3\. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. The rights to indemnification and to

the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections B1 and B2 shall be contract

rights. If a claim under Section B1 or Section B2 is not paid in full by the

Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by

the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses,

in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee

may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the

unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such

suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of

expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be

entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In

(i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification

hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to

an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit by

the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of

an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses

upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable

standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the

Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its

stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such

suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances

because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in

the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board,

independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met

such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the

indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of

such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit

brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an

advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an

advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of

proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such

advancement of expenses, under this Section or otherwise shall be on the

Corporation.



4\. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the

advancement of expenses conferred in this Section B shall not be exclusive of

any other right which any Person may have or hereafter acquire under any

statute, the



4



* * *



#####  



Corporations certificate of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of

stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.



5\. Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to

protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation

or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise

against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would

have the power to indemnify such Person against such expense, liability or

loss under the DGCL.



6\. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation. The

Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board,

grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement of expenses to any

employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions

of this Section with respect to the indemnification and advancement of

expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.



7\. Amendment. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VI, nor the

adoption of any provision of the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation

inconsistent with this Article VI, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of

this Article VI in respect of any matter occurring, or action or proceeding

accruing or arising or that, but for this Article VI, would accrue or arise,

prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.



Article VII



Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation, the

Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision, rescind or

amend in any respect any provision contained in this Certificate of

Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all

rights conferred upon a stockholder herein are granted subject to this

reservation.



Article VIII

interested stockholder following the time that such stockholder became an

interested stockholder, unless at or subsequent to such time the business

               (1) The Business Combination shall have been approved by a

majority of the Continuing Directors (as hereinafter defined); provided

however, that this condition shall not be capable of satisfaction unless

there are at least three Continuing Directors.



               (2) The Business Combination shall have been approved by the

affirmative vote in person or by proxy of the holders of not less than 75% of

the Voting Power, voting together as a single class.



               (3) All of the following conditions have been met:



                    (i) The consideration to be received by holders of shares

of a particular class or series of outstanding capital stock shall be in cash

or in the same form as the Interested Shareholder or any of its Affiliates

has previously paid for shares of such class or series of capital stock. If

the Interested Shareholder or any of its Affiliates has paid for shares of

any class or series of capital stock with varying forms of consideration, the

form of consideration to be received per share by holders of shares of such

class or series of capital stock shall be either cash or the form used to

acquire the largest number of shares of such class or series previously

acquired by the Interested Shareholder.



                    (ii) The cash or fair market value of other consideration

to be received per share by the holders of each class or series of capital

stock of the Corporation in a Business Combination with an Interested

Shareholder is not less than the highest per share price (including brokerage

commissions and/or soliciting dealers' fees) paid by such Interested

Shareholder in acquiring any shares of such class or series, respectively,

within the twenty-four months preceding the date of consummation of any such

Business Combination (appropriately adjusted for any stock split, stock

dividend, combination of shares or similar event).



                    (iii) After such Interested Shareholder has become an

Interested Shareholder and prior to the consummation of such Business

Combination: (a) except as approved by a majority of the Continuing

Directors, there shall have been no failure to declare and pay at the regular

date therefor any full quarterly dividends (whether or not cumulative) on any

outstanding Preferred Stock; (b) there shall have been (I) no reduction in

the annual rate of dividends paid on the Common Stock (except as necessary to

reflect any subdivision of the Common Stock), except as approved by a

majority of the Continuing Directors, and (II) an increase in such annual

rate of dividends as necessary to reflect any reclassification (including any

reverse stock split, reorganization, recapitalization or any similar

transaction which has the effect of reducing the number of outstanding shares

of the Common Stock), unless the failure so to increase such annual rate is

approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors; and (c) neither such

Interested Shareholder nor any of its Affiliates shall have become the

beneficial owner of any additional shares of Voting Stock except as part of

the transaction which results in such Interested Shareholder becoming an

Interested Shareholder. No approval by Continuing Directors shall satisfy the

requirements of this Subparagraph unless at the time of such approval there

are at least three Continuing Directors.



                    (iv) After such Interested Shareholder has become an

Interested Shareholder, such Interested Shareholder and any of its Affiliates

(as hereinafter defined) shall not have received the benefit, directly or

indirectly (except proportionately, solely in such Interested Shareholder's

or Affiliate's capacity as a shareholder of the Corporation), of any loans,

advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax

credits or tax advantages provided by the Corporation, whether in

anticipation of or in connection with such Business Combination or otherwise.



                    (v) A proxy or information statement describing the

proposed Business Combination and complying with the requirements of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations

thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules or

regulations) shall be mailed to all shareholders of the Corporation at least

30 days prior to the consummation of such Business Combination (whether or

not such proxy or information statement is required to be mailed pursuant to

such Act or subsequent provisions).



                    (vi) Such Interested Shareholder shall have supplied the

Corporation with such information as shall have been requested pursuant to

Section D of this Article SEVEN.



               B. For the purposes of this Article SEVEN:



               1. ""Affiliate"" or ""Associate"" shall have the respective

as in effect on March 31, 1990.



               2. A person shall be a ""beneficial owner"" of any Voting Stock:



                    (i) which such person or any of its Affiliates or

Associates beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, within the meaning of

Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act; or



                    (ii) which such person or any of its Affiliates or

Associates has (a) the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable

immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement,

arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion rights,

exchange rights, warrants or options or otherwise, or (b) the right to vote

pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (but neither such

person nor any such Affiliate or Associate shall be deemed to be the

beneficial owner of such Voting Stock solely by reason of a revocable proxy

granted for a particular meeting of shareholders, pursuant to a public

solicitation of proxies for such meeting and with respect to which neither

such person nor such Affiliate or Associate is otherwise deemed the

beneficial owner; or



                    (iii) which are beneficially owned, directly or

indirectly, within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, by any

other person with which such person or any of its Affiliates or Associates

has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,

holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Voting Stock; provided,

however, that in the case of any employee stock ownership or similar plan of

the Corporation or any Subsidiary in which the beneficiaries thereof possess

the right to vote any shares of Voting Stock held by such plan, no such plan

or any trustee with respect thereto (nor any affiliate of such trustee)

solely by reason of such capacity of such trustee shall be deemed for any

purposes hereof beneficially to own any shares of Voting Stock held under any

such plan.



               3. Business Combination shall mean any of the transactions

referred to in the following Subparagraphs (i) through (v):



               4. Any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any

Subsidiary (as hereafter defined) with (a) any Interested Shareholder (as

hereafter defined) or (b) any other person (whether or not itself an

Interested Shareholder) which is or after such merger or consolidation would

be an Affiliate (as hereafter defined) of an Interested Shareholder; or



                    (i) Any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer

or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) to or

with any Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate of any Interested

Shareholder of any assets of the Corporation or any Subsidiary having an

aggregate Fair Market Value (as hereafter defined) of $10,000,000.00 or more;

or



                    (ii) the issuance or transfer by the Corporation or any

Subsidiary (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of any securities

of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to any Interested Shareholder or any

Affiliate of any Interested Shareholder in exchange for cash, securities or

other property (or a combination thereof) having an aggregate Fair Market

Value of $10,000,000.00 or more; or



                    (iii) the adoption of any plan or proposal for the

liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation proposed by or on behalf of any

Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Shareholder; or



                    (iv) any reclassification of securities (including any

reverse stock split or recapitalization of the Corporation) or any merger or

consolidation of the Corporation with any of its Subsidiaries or any other

transaction (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving any

Interested Shareholder) which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of

increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of

equity or convertible securities of the Corporation or any Subsidiary

beneficially owned (as hereafter defined) by any Interested Shareholder or

any Affiliate of any Interested Shareholder.



               5. ""Continuing Director"" means (i) any person who is a member

of the Corporation's original Board of Directors, (ii) any member of the

Board of Directors who is unaffiliated with the Interested Shareholder and

was a member of the Board prior to the time that such Interested Shareholder

became an Interested Shareholder, and any successor of a Continuing Director

who is recommended to succeed a Continuing Director by a majority of

Continuing Directors then on the Board.



               6. ""Fair Market Value' means: (i) in the case of stock, the

highest closing sale price during the 30-day period immediately preceding the

date in question of a share of such stock on the Composite Tape for New York

Stock Exchange-Listed Stocks, or, if such stock is not quoted on the

Composite Tape, on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if such stock is not

listed on such Exchange, on the principal United States securities exchange

registered under the Exchange Act on which such stock is listed, or, if such

stock is not listed on any such exchange, the highest closing bid quotation

with respect to a share of such stock during the 30-day period preceding the

Automated Quotations System or any system then in use, or if no such

share of such stock as determined by the Board in good faith; and (ii) in the

case of property other than cash or stock, the fair market value of such

property on the date in question as determined by the Board in good faith.



               7. ""Interested Shareholder"" shall mean any person who or which:



          (i) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than

          (iii) is an assignee of or has otherwise succeeded to any shares of

Voting Stock which were at any time within the two-year period immediately

prior to the date in question beneficially owned by any Interested

Shareholder, if such assignment or succession shall have occurred in the

course of a transaction or series of transactions not involving a public

offering within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended;

provided, however, that Interested Shareholder shall not mean: (i) the

Corporation or any Subsidiary or (ii) any Person whose beneficial ownership

or expected beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Voting Power

has been disclosed to the Board of Directors of the Corporation prior to

February 19, 1990. Furthermore, in no event shall a person who or which is

the beneficial owner of less than 15 percent of the Voting Power become an

Interested Shareholder solely as a result of either of the following: (1) a

reduction in the number of shares of outstanding Voting Stock, including

without limitation a reduction caused by repurchases by the Corporation of

outstanding shares of Voting Stock, or (2) an increase of two percent or less

in the beneficial ownership of Voting Stock of such person during any

12-month period, provided that such person shall not have become the

beneficial owner of more than two percent of the Voting Stock of the

Corporation in any prior 12-month period except as a result of the original

distribution of the Common Stock of the Corporation to the holders of

Teledyne, Inc. Common Stock or pursuant to Clause (1) of this sentence;

provided, however, that if any person becomes the Beneficial Owner of 15

percent or more of the Voting Power by reason of share repurchases by the

Corporation and thereafter becomes the beneficial owner of any additional

Voting Power, except in accordance with Clause (2) of this sentence, such

Person shall be deemed to be an Interested Shareholder. For the purposes of

determining whether a person is an Interested Shareholder pursuant to this

Paragraph 6, the number of shares of Voting Stock deemed to be outstanding

shall include shares deemed owned by such person through application of

Paragraph (2) of this Section B but shall not include any other shares of

Voting Stock which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or

understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or

otherwise.



          8. A ""person"" shall mean any individual, partnership, firm,

person under Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act.



          9. ""Subsidiary"" means any corporation of which a majority of any

class of equity security is owned, directly or indirectly, by the

Corporation; provided, however, that for the purposes of the definition of

Interested Shareholder set forth in Paragraph (6) of this section B, the term

""Subsidiary"" shall mean only a corporation of which a majority of each class

of equity security is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation.



               C. In the event of any Business Combination in which the

Corporation survives, the phrase ""other consideration to be received"" as used

in Paragraph (3)(ii) of section A of this Article SEVEN shall include any

shares of capital stock of the Corporation retained by the holders of such

shares.



               D. A majority of the Directors then in office shall have the

right to demand, but only if a majority of the Directors then in office shall

then consist of Continuing Directors, or, if a majority of the Directors then

in office shall not then consist of Continuing Directors, a majority of the

then Continuing Directors shall have the right to demand, that any person who

is reasonably believed to be an Interested Shareholder (or holds of record

shares of Voting Stock beneficially owned by any Interested Shareholder)

supply the Corporation with complete information as to the (i) record

owner(s) of all shares beneficially owned by such person who is reasonably

believed to be an Interested Shareholder, (ii) number of and class and series

of shares beneficially owned by such person who is reasonably believed to be

an Interested Shareholder and held of record by each such record owner and

the numbers of the stock certificates evidencing such shares, and (iii) any

other factual matter relating to the applicability or effect of this Article

SEVEN as may be reasonably requested of such person, and such person shall

furnish such information within ten (10) days after receipt of such demand.



               E. Nothing contained in this Article SEVEN shall be construed

to relieve any Interested Shareholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed

by law.



               F. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of

Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser

vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of

any particular class or series of Voting Stock required by law or this

Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least

75% of the Voting Power, voting together as a single class, shall be required

to alter, amend or repeal this Article SEVEN; provided, however, that no

amendment of this Article SEVEN shall apply to any person who is an

Interested Shareholder at the time of the adoption of such amendment.



         EIGHT: In addition to any other considerations which the Board of

Directors lawfully may take into account in determining whether to take or

refrain from taking corporate action on any matter, including making or

declining to make any recommendations to the shareholders of the Corporation,

the Board of Directors may in its discretion consider the long term as well

as short term best interests of the Corporation (including the possibility

that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the

Corporation), taking into account and weighing as the Directors deem

appropriate the effects of such action on employees, suppliers and customers

of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the effect upon communities in

which the offices or other facilities of the Corporation are located and any

other factors the Directors consider pertinent.



         NINE: No Director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to

the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for any breach of

fiduciary duty by such Director as a Director. Notwithstanding the foregoing

sentence, a Director shall be liable to the extent provided by applicable law

(i) for any breach of the Director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or

its shareholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which

involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant

to Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which such

Director derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of

this Article NINE shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or

alleged liability of any Director of the Corporation for or with respect to

any acts or omissions of such Director occurring prior to such amendment or

repeal. If the DGCL is amended hereafter further to eliminate or limit the

personal liability of Directors, the liability of a Director of this

Corporation shall be limited or eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by

the DGCL, as amended.



         TEN: A. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a

party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is involuntarily involved

in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

investigative (a ""Proceeding""), by reason of the fact that he or she is or

was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving (during

his or her tenure as Director and/or officer) at the request of the

Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation

or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether the

basis of such Proceeding is an alleged action or inaction in an official

capacity as a Director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a

Director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the

Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL (or other applicable

law), as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense,

liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise

taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably

incurred or suffered by such person in connection with such Proceeding. Such

Director or officer shall have the right to be paid by the Corporation for

expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final

disposition; provided, however, that, if the DGCL (or other applicable law)

requires, the payment of such expenses in advance of the final disposition of

any such Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt by the Corporation of an

undertaking by or on behalf of such Director or officer to repay all amounts

so advanced if it should be determined ultimately that he or she is not

entitled to be indemnified under this Article TEN or otherwise.



               B. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under

Paragraph A of this Article TEN is not paid in full by the Corporation within

ninety (90) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation,

the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to

recover the unpaid amount of the claim, together with interest thereon, and,

if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be

paid the expense of prosecuting such claim, including reasonable attorneys'

fees incurred in connection therewith. It shall be a defense to any such

action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred

in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the

required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the

Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which

make it permissible under the DGCL (or other applicable law) for the

Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden

of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of

the Corporation (or of its Board of Directors, its Directors who are not

parties to the Proceeding with respect to which indemnification is claimed,

its shareholders, or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination

prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant

is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable

standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL (or other applicable law), nor an

actual determination by any such person or persons that such claimant has not

met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to such action or

create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of

conduct.



               C. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred by this

Article TEN shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Director,

officer, representative, employee or other agent may have or hereafter

acquire under the DGCL or any other statute, or any provision contained in

the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or any agreement,

or pursuant to a vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors, or

otherwise.



               D. Insurance and Trust Fund. In furtherance and not in

limitation of the powers conferred by statute:



                    (1) the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance

on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent

of the Corporation, or is serving at the request of the Corporation as a

Director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership,

joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted

against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his

status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to

indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of law; and



                    (2) the Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a

security interest and/or use other means (including, without limitation,

letters of credit, surety bonds and/or other similar arrangements), as well

as enter into contracts providing indemnification to the fullest extent

permitted by law and including as part thereof provisions with respect to any

or all of the foregoing, to ensure the payment of such amount as may become

necessary to effect indemnification as provided therein, or elsewhere.



               E. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation.

The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board

of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, including the right to be paid

by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in

advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Corporation

to the fullest extent permitted by law.



               F. Effect of Repeal or Modification. Any repeal or

modification of this Article TEN shall not change the rights of an officer or

Director to indemnification with respect to any action or omission occurring

prior to such repeal or modification.



               ELEVEN: The Corporation reserves the right to repeal, alter,

amend, or rescind any provision contained in this Certificate of

Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all

rights conferred on shareholders herein are granted subject to this

reservation.



               TWELVE: The name and mailing address of the sole incorporator

are as follows:

section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or

class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this

corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court

directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the

creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of

stockholders of this corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or

arrangement and to any promise or arrangement, the said compromise or

arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to

which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or

class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of

this corporation, as the case may be, and also on this corporation.



         EIGHTH. Except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of

directors for breaches of fiduciary duty, no director of the Corporation shall

be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages

for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of

law imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall

apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any

director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such

director occurring prior to such amendment.



         NINTH. 1. ACTION, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS OTHER THAN BY OR IN THE RIGHT

OF THE CORPORATION. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a

party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or

completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by

reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or

officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the

request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a

similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or

other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being

referred to hereinafter as an ""Indemnitee""), or by reason of any action alleged

to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including

attorneys' fees) judgment, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and

reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit

or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a

manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of

the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no

reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any

action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a

plea of NOLO CONTENDERE or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a

presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he

reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the

Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had

reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding

anything to the contrary in this Article, except as set forth in Section 6

below, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking indemnification

in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee

unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the

Corporation.



         2. ACTIONS OR SUITS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. The

Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is

threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or

suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by

reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or

officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the

request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a

similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or

other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any

action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all

expenses (including attorneys' fees) and amounts paid in



                                       3

<PAGE>   4



settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in

connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he

acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not

opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no

indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to

which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation

unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware shall

determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but

in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and

reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys' fees)

which the Court of Chancery of Delaware shall deem proper.



         3. INDEMNIFICATION FOR EXPENSES OF SUCCESSFUL PARTY. Notwithstanding

the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been

successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or

proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article, or in defense of any

claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or

proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys'

fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection

therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is

disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without

prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the Indemnitee, (ii) an

adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of

guilty or NOLO CONTENDERE by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the

Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to

be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with

respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the Indemnitee had

reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be

considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect

thereto.



         4. NOTIFICATION AND DEFENSE OF CLAIM. As a condition precedent to his

right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing

as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation

involving him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any

action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so

notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own

expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal

counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the

Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the

Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other

expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim,

other than as provided below in this Section 4. The Indemnitee shall have the

right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees and

expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its

assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee

unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by

the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded

that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue

between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such

action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to

assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses

of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except

as otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be

entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any

claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for

the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause

(ii) above.



         5. ADVANCE OF EXPENSES. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 below,

in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to

Section 4 of this Article of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of

which the Corporation receives notice under this Article, any expenses

(including attorneys' fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or

criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall

be paid by the Corporation in advance of the



                                       4

<PAGE>   5



final disposition of such matter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the payment of

such expense incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of

such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of

the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall

ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified

by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such undertaking shall be

accepted without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to make

such repayment.



         6. PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION. In order to obtain indemnification or

advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the

Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such

request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the

Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent

the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any

such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in

any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request

of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Section 1, 2 or 5 the

Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day

period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set

forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in

each instance by (a) a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation

consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or

proceeding in question (""disinterested directors""), even though less than

quorum, (b) a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of

all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which

quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to the

action, suit or proceeding in question, (c) independent legal counsel (who may

be regular legal counsel to the Corporation), or (d) a court of competent

jurisdiction.



         7. REMEDIES. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by

this Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent

jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if

no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred to above in

Section 6. Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the

Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advanced of expenses under this

Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to

have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that

indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met

the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the

Corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has not met such

applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a

presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

The Indemnitee's expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection

with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in

part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.



         8. SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENT. No amendment, termination or repeal of this

Article or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware

or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of

any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to

any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any

actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such

amendment, termination or repeal.



         9. OTHER RIGHTS. The indemnification and advancement of expenses

provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to

which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be

entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders

or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official

capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the

Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a

director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs,

executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this

Article shall be deemed to



                                       5

<PAGE>   6



prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into,

agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and

procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition, the

Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of

Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the

Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be

equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article.



         10. PARTIAL INDEMNIFICATION. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any

provision of this Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a

portion of the expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts

paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in

connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal,

therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall

nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses

(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to

which the Indemnitee is entitled.



         11. INSURANCE. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at

its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of

the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or

other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense,

liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his

status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify

such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General

Corporation law of Delaware.



         12. MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION. If the Corporation is merged into or

consolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving

corporation, the surviving corporation shall assume the obligations of the

Corporation under this Article with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or

investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts

occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation.



         13. SAVINGS CLAUSE. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be

invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the

Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses

(including attorneys' fees) judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in

connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,

criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the

Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this

Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted

by applicable law.



         14. DEFINITIONS. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and

Section 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall have the

respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section

145(i).



         15. SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION. If the General Corporation Law of Delaware

is amended after adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification

permitted to Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to

the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as so

amended.



         TENTH. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or

repeal any provision contained in this Third Restated Certificate of

Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute and this

Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights conferred upon

stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.



                                       6

         ELEVENTH. This Article is inserted for the management of the business

and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation.



         1. NUMBER OF DIRECTORS. The number of directors of the Corporation

shall not be less than three. The exact number of directors within the

limitations specified in the preceding sentence shall be fixed from time to time

by, or in the manner provided in, the Corporation's By-Laws.



         2. CLASSES OF DIRECTORS. The Board of Directors shall be and is divided

into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III. No one class shall have

more than one director more than any other class. If a fraction is contained in

the quotient arrived at by dividing the designated number of directors by three,

then, if such fraction is one-third, the extra director shall be a member of

Class I, and if such fraction is two-thirds, one of the extra directors shall be

a member of Class I and one of the extra directors shall be a member of Class

II, unless otherwise provided from time to time by resolution adopted by the

Board of Directors.



         3. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. Elections of directors need not be by written

ballot except as and to the extent provided in the By-Laws of the Corporation.



         4. TERMS OF OFFICE. Each director shall serve for a term ending on the

date of the third annual meeting following the annual meeting at which such

director was elected; PROVIDED, that each initial director in Class I shall

serve for a term ending on the date of the annual meeting in 1995; each initial

director in Class II shall serve for a term ending on the date of the annual

meeting in 1996; and each initial director in Class III shall serve for a term

ending on the date of the annual meeting in 1997; and PROVIDED FURTHER, that the

term of each director shall be subject to the election and qualification of his

successor and to his earlier death, resignation or removal



         5. ALLOCATION OF DIRECTORS AMONG CLASSES IN THE EVENT OF INCREASES OR

DECREASES IN THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORS. In the event of any increase or decrease

in the authorized number of directors, (i) each director then serving as such

shall nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he is a member

and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such

increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board of Directors among the

three classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class has more than one

director more than any other class. To the extent possible, consistent with the

foregoing rule, any newly created directorships shall be added to those classes

whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such

allocation, and any newly eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from

those classes whose terms of offices are to expire at the earliest dates

following such allocation, unless otherwise provided from time to time by

resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.



         6. QUORUM; ACTION AT MEETING. A majority of the directors at any time

in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the

event one or more of the directors shall be disqualified to vote at any meeting,

then the required quorum shall be reduced by one for each director so

disqualified, provided that in no case shall less than one-third of the number

of directors fixed pursuant to Section 1 above constitute a quorum. If at any

meeting of the Board of Directors there shall be less than such a quorum, a

majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time. Every act

or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting

duly held at which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the Board

of Directors unless a greater number is required by law, by the By-Laws of the

Corporation or by this Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation.



                                       7

<PAGE>   8



         7. REMOVAL. Directors of the Corporation may be removed only for cause

by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of

the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to

vote.



         8. VACANCIES. Any vacancy in the Board of Directors, however occurring,

including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board, shall be filled

only by a vote of a majority of the directors then in office, although less than

a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. A director elected to fill a vacancy

shall be elected to hold office until the next election of the class for which

such director shall have been chosen, subject to the election and qualification

of his successor and to his earlier death, resignation or removal.



         9. STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND INTRODUCTION OF BUSINESS, ETC. Advance

notice of stockholder nominations for election of directors and other business

to be brought by stockholders before a meeting of stockholders shall be given in

the manner provided by the By-Laws of the Corporation.



         10. AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law,

this Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the

Corporation, each as amended, and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser

percentage may be specified by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at

least seventy-five percent (75%) of the shares of capital stock of the

Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote shall be required to

amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article

ELEVENTH.



         TWELFTH. Stockholders of the Corporation may not take any action by

written consent in lieu of a meeting. Notwithstanding any other provisions of

law, the Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the

Corporation, each as amended, and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser

percentage may be specified by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at

least seventy-five percent (75%) of the shares of capital stock of the

Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote shall be required to

amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article

TWELFTH.



         THIRTEENTH. Special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time

by only the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer (or

if there is no Chief Executive Officer, the President) or the Board of

Directors. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be

limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of

meeting. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this Third Restated

Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Corporation, each as amended,

and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law,

the affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of

the shares of capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and

entitled to vote shall be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision

inconsistent with, this Article THIRTEENTH.



         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused its corporate seal to be

affixed hereto and this Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed

by its President this 21st day of December, 1994.

                         RED ROBIN GOURMET BURGERS, INC.



          FIRST:  The name of the Corporation is Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.



          SECOND: The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the

State of Delaware is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, Delaware

19808. The name of the registered agent of the Corporation at that address is

Corporation Service Company.



          THIRD:  The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act

or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the Delaware General

Corporation Law.



          FOURTH: A.  The total number of shares of all classes of stock which

the Corporation shall have authority to issue is Fifty Five Million

(55,000,000), consisting of Fifty Million (50,000,000) shares of Common Stock,

par value one cent ($0.001) per share (the ""Common Stock"") and Five Million

(5,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock, par value one cent ($0.001) per share

(the ""Preferred Stock"").



                  B.  The board of directors is authorized, subject to any

limitations prescribed by law, to provide for the issuance of shares of

Preferred Stock in series, and by filing a certificate pursuant to the

applicable law of the State of Delaware (such certificate being hereinafter

referred to as a ""Preferred Stock Designation""), to establish from time to time

the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the

designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series

and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The number of

authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not

below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of

the holders of a majority of the Common Stock, without a vote of the holders of

the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders

is required pursuant to the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation.



                  C.  Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the

holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders

of the Corporation for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise

required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any

amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including

any Certificate of Designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that

relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock

if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or

together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote

thereon by law or pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of

Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designations relating to any series

of Preferred Stock).



                  D.  Immediately upon the effectiveness of this Amended and

Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each two and nine-tenths (2.9) issued and

outstanding



                                        1

shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, shall,

without further action by the Corporation or the holder thereof, be combined,

reclassified, and changed into one (1) share of Common Stock rounded to the

nearest whole share. Each person at the time of the effectiveness of this

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation holding of record any issued

and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to

receive a stock certificate or certificates to evidence and represent the shares

of Common Stock to which he/she/it becomes entitled (in replacement of the stock

certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock which

he/she/it currently holds of record) by reason of such reverse stock split.""



          FIFTH:  The following provisions are inserted for the management of

the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further

definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of

its directors and stockholders:



                  A.  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be

managed by or under the direction of the board of directors. In addition to the

powers and authority expressly conferred upon them by statute or by this Amended

and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation, the

directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts

and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation.



                  B.  The directors of the Corporation need not be elected by

written ballot unless the by-laws so provide.



                  C.  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the

stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or

special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by

any consent in writing by such stockholders.



                  D.  Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be

called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the board

of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole

Board or by holders of at least ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all of

the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to

vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the term

""Whole Board"" shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not

there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.



          SIXTH:  A.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of

Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the

number of directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the board of

directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. The

directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series of

Preferred Stock under specified circumstances, shall be divided into three

classes, with the term of office of the first class to expire at the

Corporation's first annual meeting of stockholders, the term of office of the

second class to expire at the Corporation's second annual meeting of

stockholders and the term of office of the third class to expire at the

Corporation's third annual meeting of stockholders, with each director to hold



                                       -2-



<PAGE>



office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. At

each annual meeting of stockholders, directors elected to succeed those

directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification,

removal from office or other cause shall, unless otherwise required by law or by

resolution of the board of directors, be filled only by a majority vote of the

capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of

directors, voting together as a single class.

or repeal by-laws of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the

by-laws of the Corporation by the board of directors shall require the approval

of a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have power to

in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the

Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of

Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty six and two

thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding

director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts

or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a

knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General

director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent

permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or

protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal

or modification.

class or series of the stock of this corporation required by law or by this

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the

holders of at least sixty six and two thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting

power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the

Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors, voting

together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal this Article

agreement or arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding,

voting or disposing of this corporation's voting securities.



         For the purpose of this Article FOURTEENTH, in determining whether a

corporation, person, group, firm, trust, partnership or other entity owns

beneficially, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of this corporation's

outstanding voting securities, this corporation's outstanding voting securities

will be deemed to include any voting securities that may be issuable pursuant to

any agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon exercise of conversion

or other entity pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 1

notwithstanding the inability of such entity to vote such shares.



         (b) Continuing Director' means any member of the Board of Directors of

having an aggregate fair market value at the time of such transaction of less

than $10,000,000) in exchange for any voting securities (or securities

convertible into or exchangeable for voting securities, or options, warrants or

rights to purchase voting securities or securities convertible into or

exchangeable for voting securities) of this corporation or any subsidiary of

this corporation; or



                  (iv) any reclassification of securities, reverse stock split

or combination of shares, recapitalization or other transaction designed to

decrease the number of holders of this corporation's voting securities remaining

after any other corporation, person, group, firm, trust, partnership or other

entity has become an Acquiring Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any

transaction which would otherwise constitute a Special Business Combination

shall not constitute a Special Business Combination if the conditions specified

in subsection (x) or subsection (y) of this paragraph 1(c) are satisfied:



         (x)      a majority of the Continuing Directors approve the

transaction, provided that this condition (x) shall not be capable of

satisfaction unless there is at least one Continuing Director; or



         (y)      the transaction



                  (i) does not change any voting security holder's percentage

ownership of voting securities in any successor to this corporation from the

percentage of voting securities beneficially owned by such holder in this

corporation; and







<PAGE>



                  (ii) provides that the provisions of this Article, without any

amendment, change, alteration or deletion, will apply to any successor to this

corporation; and

corporation's assets, other than to a wholly owned subsidiary of this

the outstanding voting securities of this corporation entitled to vote at such

meeting shall be required to constitute a quorum at any such meeting. The

affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding voting

securities of this corporation entitled to vote at such meeting shall be

required for approval of any such Special Business Combination.



         (3)      The quorum and affirmative vote required by this Article will

required by law, this Certificate of Incorporation, a resolution providing for

the issuance of a class or series of stock which has been adopted by the Board

of Directors or any agreement between this corporation and any national

securities exchange.

this Article may be effected unless it is approved at a meeting of this

corporation's stockholders called for that purpose. The presence in person or by

proxy of the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding voting securities of

this corporation entitled to vote at such meeting shall be required to

this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at

least 75% of the outstanding voting securities entitled to vote at such meeting

shall be required to amend, alter, change, or repeal, directly or indirectly,

any provision of this Article.



THIRTEENTH. A director of this corporation shall not be personally liable to

this corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of

fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the

director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts

or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a

knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General

Corporation Law, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended, or (iv) for any

transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the

Delaware General Corporation Law hereafter is amended to authorize the further

elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a

director of this corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal

liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by

the amended Delaware General Corporation Law. Any repeal or modification of this

paragraph by the stockholders of this corporation shall be prospective only, and

shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a

director of this corporation existing at the time of such repeal or

modification.

         FOURTH:



         PART A. CLASSES OF STOCK



         The maximum number of shares which the Corporation is authorized to

issue and to have outstanding at any time shall be Eighty-Seven Million, which

shall be classified as follows:



                 (a) Eighty Million (80,000,000) of said shares shall be

         Common Stock, without par value; and



                 (b) Seven Million (7,000,000) of said shares shall be Series

         Preferred Stock without par value (no par value Preferred Stock).



         PART B. SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK



         SECTION 1.  DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT.  The shares of such series shall

be designated as ""Series A Preferred Stock"" (the ""Series A Preferred Stock"")

and the number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred Stock shall be

five hundred thousand (500,000).  Such number of shares may be increased or

decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that no decrease

shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less

than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved

for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or

upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation

convertible into Series A Preferred Stock.



         SECTION 2.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.



                 (a) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any

         series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and

         superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,

         the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to

         the holders of Common Stock, no par value, (the ""Common Stock"") of the

         Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to

         receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of

         funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable

         in cash on (each such date being referred to herein as a ""Quarterly

         Dividend Payment Date""), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend

         Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a

         share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to

         the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i) $1 or (ii) subject to

         the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth 100 times the

         aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the

         aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends

         or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of

         Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common

         Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock

         since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or,

         with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the

         first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A

         Preferred Stock.  In the event the Corporation shall at any



                                       2

<PAGE>   3

         time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares

         of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or

         consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

         reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares

         of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common

         Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of

         Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event

         under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by

         multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the

         number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such

         event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common

         Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

        

                 (b) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution

         on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of this

         Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on

         the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common

         Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall

         have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any

         Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly

         Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1 per share on the Series A

         Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent

         Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.



                 (c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on

         outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly

         Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares,

         unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date

         for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends

         on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such

         shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment

         Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of

         holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a

         quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in

         either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be

         cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but

         unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the

         shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total

         amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such

         shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all

         such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a

         record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A

         Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or

         distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more

         than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.



         SECTION 3.  VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of shares of Series A

Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:



                 (a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set

         forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder

         thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the

         stockholders of the Corporation.  In the event the Corporation



                                       3

<PAGE>   4

         shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock

         payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or

         combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock

         (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in

         shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of 

         Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to

         which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled

         immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such

         number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares

         of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the

         denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

         outstanding immediately prior to such event.

        

                 (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other

         Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or

         any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series A

         Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any

         other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights

         shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of

         stockholders of the Corporation.



                 (c) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by

         law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting

         rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent

         they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth

         herein) for taking any corporate action.



         SECTION 4.  CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.



                 (a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or

         distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in

         Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid

         dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of

         Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the

         Corporation shall not:



                     (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other

                 distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either

                 as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding

                 up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;



                     (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other

                 distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity

                 (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or

                 winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except

                 dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all

                 such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears

                 in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all

                 such shares are then entitled;



                                       4

<PAGE>   5

                     (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for

                 consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to

                 dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to

                 the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation

                 may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares

                 of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock

                 of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or

                 upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A

                 Preferred Stock; or



                     (iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for

                 consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any

                 shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A

                 Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer

                 made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board

                 of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as

                 the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective

                 annual dividend rates and other relative rights and

                 preferences of the respective series and classes, shall

                 determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable

                 treatment among the respective series or classes.



                 (b) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the

         Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any

         shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under

         paragraph (a) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such

         shares at such time and in such manner.



         SECTION 5.  REACQUIRED SHARES.  Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock

purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever

shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All

such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares

of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred

Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein,

in the Restated Articles of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of

Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as

otherwise required by law.



         SECTION 6.  LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.  Upon any

liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution

shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as

to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A

Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A

Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to

accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not

declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of Shares of

Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per

share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to

100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares

of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity

(either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with

the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions



                                       5

<PAGE>   6

made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in

proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are

entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  In the event the

Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock

payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or

consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or

otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a

greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the

aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were

entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of the

preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction

the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

immediately after such event and the  denominator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



         SECTION 7.  CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC.  In case the Corporation shall

enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which

the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or

securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of

Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or

changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment

hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock,

securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may

be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.

In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on

the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or

combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common

Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each

such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the

exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by

multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the

denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



         SECTION 8.  NO REDEMPTION.  The shares of Series A Preferred Stock

shall not be redeemable.



         SECTION 9.  RANK.  The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with

respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to

all series of any other class of the Corporation's Preferred Stock.



         SECTION 10. AMENDMENT.  The Articles of Incorporation of the

Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or

change the powers, preferences or special Rights of the Series A Preferred

Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the

holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred

Stock, voting together as a single class.

         PART C. EXPRESS TERMS OF NO PAR VALUE PREFERRED STOCK



         The express terms and provisions of the no par value Preferred Stock

shall be as follows:



         SECTION 1.  DESIGNATION.  All shares of no par value Preferred

Stock shall be of equal rank and shall be identical except in respect to the

particulars as may be fixed and determined by the Board of Directors as

hereinafter provided, and each share of each series shall be identical in all

respects with all other shares of such series, except as to the date from which

dividends are cumulative.



         The Board of Directors is hereby authorized in respect of any unissued

shares of no par value Preferred Stock to fix or change:



                 (a) The division of such shares into series, the designation

         of each series (which may be by distinguishing number, letter or

         title) and the authorized number of shares in each series, which

         number may be increased (except where otherwise provided by the Board

         of Directors in creating the series) or decreased (but not below the

         number of shares thereof outstanding) by like action of the Board of

         Directors;



                 (b) The annual dividend rates of each series;



                 (c) The dates at which dividends, if declared, shall be

         Payable;



                 (d) The redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for

         shares of the series;



                 (e) The terms and amounts of any Sinking Fund provided for the

         purchase or redemption of shares of the series;



                 (f) The amounts payable on shares of the series in the event   

         of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding

         up of the affairs of the corporation;



                 (g) Whether the shares of the series shall be convertible

         into Common Stock and, if so, the conversion price or prices and the

         adjustments thereof, if any, and all other terms and conditions upon

         which such conversion may be made; and

        

                 (h) Restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same

         series or of any other class or series.



         SECTION 2.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.  The holders of the no par

value Preferred Stock of each series shall be entitled to receive out of any

funds legally available for no par value Preferred Stock as and when declared

by the Board of Directors, dividends in cash at the rate for such series fixed

by the Board of Directors in the manner set forth in Section 1 hereof and no

more, payable quarterly on the dates fixed for such series. Such dividends

shall be cumulative, in the case of shares of each particular series, from and

after the date of issuance



                                       7

<PAGE>   8

thereof. No dividends may be paid or declared or set apart for any of the no

par value Preferred Stock for any quarterly dividend period unless at the same

time a like proportionate dividend for the same quarterly dividend period,

ratably in proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor,

shall be paid upon or declared or set apart for all no par value Preferred

Stock, of all series then issued and outstanding and entitled to receive such

dividend.



         SECTION 3.  CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.         In no event, so long as any

no par value Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, shall any dividends, except

a dividend payable in Common Stock, be paid or declared or any distribution be

made, except as aforesaid, on the Common Stock, nor shall any Common Stock be

purchased, retired or otherwise acquired by the corporation:



                 (a) Unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on no par value

         Preferred Stock, including the full dividends for the current

         quarterly dividend period, shall have been declared and paid, or a sum

         sufficient for payment thereof set apart; and



                 (b) Unless there shall be no arrearages with respect to the

         redemption of no par value Preferred Stock of any series from any

         Sinking Fund provided for shares of such series by the Board of

         Directors in the manner set forth in Section 1 hereof.



         SECTION 4.  LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.



                 (a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the holders of the no

         par value Preferred Stock of any series shall, in case of voluntary or

         involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of

         the corporation, be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of

         the corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be

         paid or distributed among the holders of the Common Stock the amounts

         fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with the

         decision of the Board of Directors in the manner set forth in Section

         1 hereof plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid

         thereon to the date of payment of the amounts due pursuant to such

         liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the

         corporation.



                 (b) The merger or consolidation of the corporation into or

         with any other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation

         into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all

         the property of the corporation, shall not be deemed to be a

         dissolution, liquidation or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for

         the purpose of this Section 4.



         SECTION 5.  VOTING RIGHTS.        The holders of no par Preferred

Stock shall be entitled at all times to one (1) vote for each share; and,

except as required by law, the holders of such no par value Preferred Stock and

the holders of Common Stock of the corporation shall vote together as one (1)

class on all matters.



                                       8

         FIFTH: The authority of this Corporation, its shareholders and

directors, is subject to the following:



                 (a) No holder of shares of this Corporation, regardless of

         class, shall be entitled as a matter of right to exercise any

         preemptive rights, to subscribe for or to purchase shares of any

         class, now or hereafter authorized, or to purchase or subscribe for

         securities which are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of

         the Corporation, regardless of class, or to which shall be attached or

         appertain any warrants or rights entitling the holder thereof to

         subscribe for or purchase shares of the Corporation, regardless of

         class, except such rights to subscribe for or purchase, at such prices

         and according to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors

         may, from time to time, approve and authorize in its sole discretion.



                 (b) The Corporation may purchase its shares, regardless of

         class, from time to time, and upon such terms and conditions as the

         Board of Directors shall determine; provided, however, that the

         Corporation shall not purchase any of its shares if, after such

         purchase, its assets would be less than its liabilities plus stated

         capital and unless the Corporation first complies with Section 225.6

         of Regulation Y, 12 C.F.R. 225.6, as promulgated and amended, from

         time to time, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,

         to the extent that such regulation may be applicable to the purchase.



                 (c) No shareholder shall have the right to vote cumulatively

         in the election of directors.



         SIXTH: The Corporation may indemnify any director or officer, any

former director or officer of the Corporation and any person who is or has

served at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (and

his heirs, executors and administrators) against expenses, including attorneys'

fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably

incurred by him by reason of the fact that he is or was such director, officer

         SEVENTH:



                 (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article

         SEVENTH, any Business Combination (as hereinafter defined) with an

         Interested Party (as hereinafter defined) or any Affiliate (as

         hereinafter defined) thereof shall require the affirmative vote of at

         least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of each class of

         capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled

         to vote as a class and a majority of each class of those shares of

         capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled

         to vote as a class other than those shares beneficially owned by an

         Interested Party and any Affiliate thereof. For the purpose of this

         Article SEVENTH, an ""Interested Party"" is defined as a corporation,

         person or entity that, together with all Affiliates thereof, is the

         beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent (10%) or more

         of the shares of any class of capital stock of the Corporation issued

         and outstanding and entitled to vote.



                 (b) The provisions of this Article SEVENTH set forth in

         paragraph (a) hereof shall not apply to any Business Combination:



                     (1) with an Interested Party if the Board of Directors of

                 the Corporation shall have approved, by resolution, a

                 memorandum of understanding or agreement with such Interested

                 Party, a transaction substantially consistent with such

                 Business Combination prior to or simultaneously at the time

                 such Interested Party, together with all Affiliates thereof,

                 became the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten

                 percent (10%) or more of any class of the outstanding shares

                 of capital stock of the Corporation; or



                     (2) (i) which has been approved at any time before

                 consummation thereof by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the total

                 membership of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and a

                 majority of the Continuing Directors (as hereinafter defined)

                 of the Corporation at the time of said vote; and



                     (ii) which provides for a price to be paid in cash for the

                 shares of capital stock of the Corporation in an amount not

                 less than the highest price, including commissions, previously

                 paid by such Interested Party for any of the shares of the

                 Corporation's capital stock of that class.



                 (c) For the purposes of this Article SEVENTH: (1) an

         Interested Party shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of any

         shares of capital stock of the Corporation if such Interested Party

         would be deemed the beneficial owner of such shares under the General

         Rules and Regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as

         presently in effect, and (2) the term ""Affiliate"" shall have the

         meaning ascribed to such term in Rule 12b-2 of such Rules and

         Regulations as presently in effect.

<PAGE>   11

                 (d) A majority of the Continuing Directors shall determine for

         the purposes of this Article SEVENTH, on the basis of information then

         known to it, whether (1) any Interested Party beneficially owns,

         together with its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, ten percent

         (10%) or more of a class of the outstanding shares of capital stock of

         the Corporation entitled to vote as a class, (2) any sale, lease,

         exchange or other disposition of part of the assets of the Corporation

         involves substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, (3) the

         memorandum of understanding or agreement referred to above is

         substantially consistent with the transaction to which it relates, and

         (4) if an Interested Party purchases capital stock for consideration

         other than cash, the ""price"" paid by the Interested Party for such

         capital stock. A corporation, person or other entity purchasing shares

         of capital stock of any class directly from the Corporation shall not

         be deemed an Interested Person by reason of such purchase if such

         determination is not made later than simultaneously with such

         purchase. Any such determination by the Continuing Directors shall be

         conclusive and binding for all purposes of this Article SEVENTH.



                 (e) A Business Combination, for the purposes of this Article

         SEVENTH, shall mean:



                     (1) any merger or consolidation of the Corporation, or a

                 subsidiary of the Corporation, into or with any other person,

                 corporation or entity; or



                     (2) any sale, lease, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other

                 disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the

                 Corporation to or with any other corporation, person or

                 entity; or



                     (3) any reclassification of securities (including a

                 reverse stock split) or recapitalization of the Corporation,

                 or any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any

                 subsidiaries or any other transaction which has the effect of

                 increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares

                 of any class of equity or convertible securities of the

                 Corporation or any subsidiary which is directly or indirectly

                 owned by any corporation, person or other entity; or



                     (4) the issuance or transfer by the Corporation or any

                 subsidiary (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of

                 any securities of the Corporation or any subsidiary to any

                 corporation, person or entity of a number or amount of

                 securities equal to five percent (5%) or more of the then

                 outstanding number or amount of any class of the Corporation's

                 securities to a corporation, person or other entity; or



                     (5) the adoption of any plan as proposed for liquidation

                 or dissolution of the Corporation proposed by or on behalf of

                 any corporation, person or entity.

                 (f) For the purposes of this Article SEVENTH, the term

         Continuing Directors shall mean those members of the Board of

         Directors of the Corporation (1) elected by the shareholders, or

         otherwise appointed, prior to the time when the Interested Party and

         any Affiliate acquired four percent (4%) of the shares of a class of

         the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and

         entitled to vote or (2) a person recommended to succeed a Continuing

         Director by a majority of the Continuing Directors.



                 (g) This Article SEVENTH may not be amended or repealed except

         by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent

         (80%) of the shares of each class of capital stock of the Corporation

         of those shares of each class of capital stock of the Corporation

         issued and outstanding and entitled to vote as a class other than

         those shares beneficially owned by an Interested Party and any

         Affiliate thereof; provided, however, that the only vote required for

         amendment or repeal shall be the affirmative vote of the holders of

         two-thirds (2/3) of such issued and outstanding shares if the Board of

         Directors of the Corporation proposes the amendment or repeal by

         resolution approved by seventy-five percent (75%) of the total

         membership of the Board of Directors and a majority of the Continuing

         Directors.

share, on the Class C Common Stock; and no cash dividend or dividend of

property or stock, other than stock as provided for in subsection (c)(iii)

below, may be declared and paid, per share, on the Class C Common Stock unless

declared and paid, per share, on the Common Stock; and provided that if any

cash dividend or dividend of property or stock, other than as provided for in

subsection (c)(iii) below, shall be declared and paid, per share, on the Class

B Common Stock, then



3



* * *



a dividend of an equal or greater amount of cash or value of property or stock

shall be declared and paid, per share, on the Class C Common Stock;



(iii) If any dividend of shares of any class of common stock is paid to

equal dividend of shares of Class C Common Stock shall be declared and paid to

holders of Common Stock and Class C Common Stock; and provided further that if

only shares of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock are outstanding

Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding at any time are split or

subdivided, whether by stock distribution, reclassification, recapitalization

or otherwise, so as to increase the number of shares thereof issued and

outstanding, then the shares of Class C Common Stock shall be split or

subdivided, whether by stock distribution, reclassification, recapitalization

or otherwise, so that the number of shares thereof outstanding shall be

proportionately increased in order to maintain the same proportionate equity

ownership (i.e., the same proportion of shares held by each class) among the

holders of Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock as

existed on the date prior to such split or subdivision; similarly, if shares

of Class C Common Stock shall be split or subdivided in any manner, then all

other outstanding classes of common stock shall be proportionately split or

subdivided;



(v) If shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding at any time

are reverse split or combined, whether by reclassification, recapitalization

or otherwise, so as to decrease the number of shares thereof issued and

outstanding, then the shares of all other classes of common stock shall be

reverse split or combined so that the number of shares thereof outstanding

shall be proportionately decreased in order to maintain the same proportionate

ownership (i.e., the same proportion of shares held by each class) between the

holders of Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock as

existed on the date prior to the reverse split or combination; similarly, if

shares of Class C Common Stock are reverse split or combined in any manner,

all other outstanding classes of common stock shall be proportionately reverse

split or combined;



(vi) In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation, or a

winding up of its affairs, whether voluntary or involuntary, or a merger or

consolidation of the Corporation, after payment or provision for payment of

the debts or liabilities of the Corporation, holders of Class C Common Stock

shall be entitled to share pro rata in the remaining assets of the Corporation

with the holders of all other outstanding classes of common stock.

created or the vacancy occurred and until such Director's successor shall have

been elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of Directors constituting

  The foregoing clauses shall be construed both as objects and powers, and each

as an independent right and power, and it is hereby expressly provided that the

enumeration herein of specific objects and powers shall not be held to limit or

restrict in any manner the general powers of this Corporation, and all the

powers and purposes hereinbefore enumerated shall be exercised, carried out and

enjoyed by this Corporation within the Commonwealth of Virginia and outside of

the Commonwealth of Virginia to such extent and in such manner as a corporation

of this character organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia may

properly and legally exercise, carry out and enjoy, but nothing herein contained

shall be deemed to authorize or permit this Corporation to carry on any business

or exercise any power or do any act which a corporation of this character,

formed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, may not at the time

lawfully carry on or do.



  ""FOURTH:  The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall have

authority to issue shall be 70,000,000 shares, of which 10,000,000 shares shall

be Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share (hereinafter called Preferred Stock),

and 60,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, par value $1 per share (hereinafter

called Common Stock).



   The following is a description of each of said different classes of stock,

and a statement of the preferences, limitations, voting rights and relative

rights in respect of the shares of each such class:



     1.  The Board of Directors shall have authority, by resolution or

  resolutions, at any time and from time to time to divide and establish any or

  all of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock not then allocated to any series

  of Preferred Stock into one or more series, and, without limiting the

  generality of the foregoing, to fix and determine the designation of each such

  series, the number of shares which shall constitute such series and the

  following relative rights and preferences of the shares of each series so

  established:



       (a) The annual dividend rate payable on shares of such series, the time

     of payment thereof, whether such dividends shall be cumulative or non-

     cumulative, and the date or dates from which any cumulative dividends shall

     commence to accrue;



       (b) the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions, if any, on

     which shares of such series may be redeemed;



       (c) the amounts payable upon shares of such series in the event of the

     voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the

     affairs of the Corporation;



       (d) the sinking fund provisions, if any, for the redemption or purchase

     of shares of such series;



       (e) the extent of the voting powers, if any, of the shares of such

     series;



       (f) the terms and conditions, if any, on which shares of such series may

     be converted into shares of stock of the Corporation of any other class or

     classes or into shares of any other series of the same or any other class

     or classes;



       (g) whether, and if so the extent to which, shares of such series may

     participate with the Common Stock in any dividends in excess of the

     preferential dividend fixed for shares of such series or in any

     distribution of the assets of the Corporation, upon a liquidation,

     dissolution or winding-up thereof, in excess of the preferential amount

     fixed for shares of such series; and



       (h) any other preferences and relative, optional or other special rights,

     and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences or

     rights, of shares of such series not fixed and determined by law or in this

     Article FOURTH.

<PAGE>

 

     2.  Each series of Preferred Stock shall be so designated as to distinguish

  the shares thereof from the shares of all other series.  Different series of

  Preferred Stock shall not be considered to constitute different classes of

  shares for the purpose of voting by classes except as otherwise fixed by the

  Board of Directors with respect to any series at the time of the creation

  thereof.



     3.  So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the

  Corporation shall not declare and pay or set apart for payment any dividends

  (other than dividends payable in Common Stock or other stock of the

  Corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock as to dividends) or make any

  other distribution on such junior stock, if at the time of making such

  declaration, payment or distribution the Corporation shall be in default with

  respect to any dividend payable on, or any obligation to retire, shares of

  Preferred Stock.



     4.  Shares of any series of Preferred Stock which have been redeemed or

  otherwise reacquired by the Corporation (whether through the operation of a

  sinking fund, upon conversion or otherwise) shall, upon cancellation in

  accordance with law, have the status of authorized and unissued shares of

  Preferred Stock and may be redesignated and reissued as a part of such series

  or of any other series of Preferred Stock.  Shares of Common Stock which have

  been reacquired by the Corporation shall, upon cancellation in accordance with

  law, have the status of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock and may

  be reissued.



     5.  Subject to the provisions of any applicable law or of the By-laws of

  the Corporation as from time to time amended with respect to the closing of

  the transfer books or the fixing of a record date for the determination of

  stockholders entitled to vote, and except as otherwise provided by law or in

  resolutions of the Board of Directors establishing any series of Preferred

  Stock pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article FOURTH, the

  holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation shall

  exclusively possess voting power for the election of directors and for all

  other purposes, each holder of record of shares of Common Stock of the

  Corporation being entitled to one vote for each share of such stock standing

  in his name on the books of the Corporation.



     6.  No holder of shares of stock of any class of the Corporation shall, as

  such holder, have any right to subscribe for or purchase (a) any shares of

  stock of any class of the Corporation, or any warrants, options or other

  instruments that shall confer upon the holder thereof the right to subscribe

  for or purchase or receive from the Corporation any shares of stock of any

  class, whether or not such shares shall be unissued shares, now or hereafter

  authorized, or shares acquired by the Corporation after the issue thereof, and

  whether or not such shares of stock, warrants, options or other instruments

  are issued for cash or services or property or by way of dividend or

  otherwise, or (b) any other security of the Corporation which shall be

  convertible into, or exchangeable for, any shares of stock of the Corporation

  of any class or classes, or to which shall be attached or appurtenant any

  warrant, option or other instrument that shall confer upon the holder of such

  security the right to subscribe for or purchase or receive from the

  Corporation any shares of its stock of any class or classes, whether or not

  such shares shall be unissued shares, now or hereafter authorized, or shares

  acquired by the Corporation after the issue thereof, and whether or not such

  securities are issued for cash or services or property or by way of dividend

  or otherwise, other than such right, if any, as the Board of Directors, in its

  sole discretion, may from time to time determine.  If the Board of Directors

  shall offer to the holders of shares of stock of any class of the Corporation,

  or any of them, any such shares of stock, options, warrants, instruments or

  other securities of the Corporation, such offer shall not, in any way,

  constitute a waiver or release of the right of the Board of Directors

  subsequently to dispose of other securities of the Corporation without

  offering the same to said holders.



     7.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, dividends upon shares

  of any class of stock of the Corporation shall be payable only out of assets

  legally available for the payment of such dividends, and the rights of the

  holders of shares of stock of the Corporation in respect of dividends shall at

  all times be subject to the power of the Board of Directors to determine what

  dividends, if any, shall be declared and paid to the stockholders.

<PAGE>

 

     8.  Subject to the provisions hereof and except as otherwise provided by

  law, shares of stock of any class of the Corporation may be issued for such

  consideration and for such corporate purposes as the Board of Directors may

  from time to time determine.



  ""FIFTH:  The period of the duration of the Corporation is unlimited and

perpetual.



   ""SIXTH:

      1.  The number of directors shall be as specified in the By-laws of the

  Corporation but such number may be increased or decreased from time to time in

  such manner as may be prescribed in the By-laws.  In no event shall such

  number exceed 18.  In the absence of a By-law specifying the number of

  directors, the number shall be 15.  Commencing with the 1985 annual meeting of

  stockholders, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes,

  Class I, Class II, and Class III, as nearly equal in number as possible.  At

  the 1985 annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the first class (Class

  I) shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 1986 annual

  meeting of stockholders; directors of the second class (Class II) shall be

  elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 1987 annual meeting of

  stockholders; and directors of the third class (Class III) shall be elected to

  hold office for a term expiring at the 1988 annual meeting of stockholders.

  At each annual meeting of stockholders after 1985, the successors to the class

  of directors whose term shall then expire shall be identified as being of the

  same class as the directors they succeed and elected to hold office for a term

  expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders.  When the

  number of directors is changed, any newly-created directorships or any

  decrease in directorships shall be so apportioned among the classes by the

  Board of Directors as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as

  possible.



      2.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any Preferred Stock then

   outstanding, directors may be removed only with cause.



      3.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any Preferred Stock then

  outstanding, newly-created directorships resulting from any increase in the

  number of directors and any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from

  death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause shall be filled

  solely by the Board of Directors or at an annual meeting of stockholders by

  the stockholders entitled to vote on the election of directors.  Unless

  otherwise provided by law, directors so chosen by the stockholders shall hold

  office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders at which the

  term of the class to which they have been elected expires.  If the directors

  remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the Board, they may fill

  the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors remaining

  in office.



  ""SEVENTH:  The amount of real estate to which the holdings of the Corporation

at any one time are to be limited is five million (5,000,000) acres.



  ""EIGHTH:  The following provisions are inserted for the regulation of the

business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and it is

expressly provided that the same are to be in furtherance and not in limitation

or exclusion of the powers conferred by statute or otherwise:



      1.  Except where other notice is specifically required by statute, written

  notice of any meeting of stockholders given as provided by the By-laws of the

  Corporation shall be sufficient without publication or other form of notice.



      2.  A meeting of the stockholders, other than the annual meeting of

  stockholders, may be held at any time but only upon the call of the Board of

  Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the President or the holders of a

  majority of the shares of issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation

  entitled to vote at the meeting.



      3.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the

  laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Board of Directors is expressly

  authorized and empowered:



         (a) To make, alter, amend and repeal the By-laws, subject to the power

      of the stockholders to alter or repeal the By-laws made by the Board of

      Directors.

<PAGE>

 

         (b) Subject to the applicable provisions of the By-laws then in effect,

      to determine, from time to time, whether and to what extent and at what

      times and places and under what conditions and regulations the accounts

      and books of the Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the

      inspection of the stockholders, and no stockholder shall have any right to

      inspect any account or book or document of the Corporation, except as

      conferred by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, unless and until

      authorized so to do by resolution of the Board of Directors or of the

      stockholders of the Corporation.



         (c) By resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors,

      (i) to designate two or more of their number, to constitute an executive

      committee, which, to the extent provided in such resolution, shall have

      and may exercise the power of the Board of Directors in the management of

      the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may have power to

      authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which

      require it; and (ii) to appoint such other committees, agents and

      representatives as may be necessary and convenient for the conduct or the

      management of the business of the Corporation.



         (d) To determine whether any, and, if any, what part, of the net

      earnings of the Corporation or of its net assets in excess of its capital

      shall be declared in dividends and paid to the stockholders, and to direct

      and determine the use and disposition of any such net earnings or such net

      assets in excess of capital for any lawful purpose of the Corporation,

      and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from time to time

      as the Board of Directors may deem necessary or desirable, to set aside

      reserves for any purpose, to fix from time to time the amount of earnings

      to be reserved for working capital and to set aside such reserves or make

      such other provisions for additions, improvements and betterments to plant

      and equipment, for expansion of the business of the Corporation (including

      the acquisition of real and personal property for that purpose), for plans

      for maintaining employment at the plants of the Corporation, and for other

      plans for the benefit of employees generally.



         (e) To establish pension, bonus, profit-sharing or other types of

      incentive or compensation plans for the officers and employees (including

      officers and employees who are also directors) of the Corporation and its

      subsidiaries and to fix the amount of earnings to be distributed or shared

      and to determine the persons to participate in any such plans and the

      amounts of their respective participations.



         (f) To issue and sell or grant options fort he purchase of shares of

      Common Stock to officers and employees (including officers and employees

      who are also directors) of the Corporation and its subsidiaries for such

      consideration and on such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors

      may from time to time determine.



      In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute

  expressly conferred upon it, the Board of Directors may exercise all such

  powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the

  Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the laws of the

  Commonwealth of Virginia, of these Articles of Incorporation and of the By-

  laws of the Corporation.



      4.  No contract or other transaction between the Corporation and any other

  corporation and no other act of the Corporation shall, in the absence of

  fraud, in any way be affected or invalidated by the fact that any of the

  directors of the Corporation are pecuniarily or otherwise interested in, or

  are directors or officers of, such other corporation.  Any director of the

  Corporation individually or any firm or association of which any director may

  be a member, may be a party to, or may be pecuniarily or otherwise interested

  in, any contract or transaction of the Corporation, provided that the fact

  that he individually or such firm or association is so interested shall be

  disclosed or shall have been known to the Board of Directors or a majority of

  such members thereof as shall be present at any meeting of the Board of

  Directors at which action upon any such contract or transaction shall be

  taken.  Any director of the Corporation who is also a director or officer of

  such other corporation or who is so interested may be counted in determining

  the existence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board of Directors which shall

  authorize any such contract or transaction, and may vote thereat to authorize

  any such contract or transaction, with like force and effect as if he were not

  such director or officer of such other corporation or not so interested.  Any

  director of the Corporation may vote upon any contract or other

  transaction between the Corporation and any subsidiary or affiliated

  corporation without regard to the fact that he is also a director of such

  subsidiary or affiliated corporation.



     Any contract, transaction or act of the Corporation or of the directors,

  which shall be ratified by a majority of a quorum of the stockholders of the

  Corporation at any annual meeting, or at any special meeting called for such

  purpose, shall, insofar as permitted by law or by these Articles of

  Incorporation, be as valid and as binding as though ratified by every

  stockholder of the Corporation; provided, however, that any failure of the

  stockholders to approve or ratify any such contract, transaction or act, when

  and if submitted, shall not be deemed in any way to invalidate the same or

  deprive the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees, of its or their

  right to proceed with such contract, transaction or act.



     Subject to any limitation in the By-laws, the members of the Board of

  Directors shall be entitled to reasonable fees, salaries or other compensation

  for their services and to reimbursement for their expenses as such members.

  Nothing contained herein shall preclude any director from serving the

  Corporation, or any subsidiary or affiliated corporation, in any other

  capacity and receiving proper compensation therefor.""



   3.  The Corporation hereby certifies that the foregoing restatement of the

Articles of Incorporation does not contain an amendment to the Articles of

Incorporation requiring shareholder approval, and that the Board of Directors

duly adopted such restatement on June 26, 1986.

                               AVON PRODUCTS, INC.  

 

                   Under Section 807 of the Business Corporation Law  

 

 

 

     We, JAMES E. PRESTON and WARD M. MILLER, JR., being  

respectively Chairman of the Board and Secretary of AVON PRODUCTS,  

INC. (the ""Corporation""), do hereby certify as follows: 

 

     1.  The name of the Corporation is AVON PRODUCTS, INC.  

and the name under which the Corporation was formed is California  

Perfume Company, Inc. 

 

     2.  The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was  

filed by the Department of State of the State of New York on January 27,  

1916. 

 

     3.  The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation as  

heretofore amended is hereby further amended to reflect an amendment  

of the first paragraph of Article III authorized by a majority vote of 

the Corporation's Board of Directors followed by authorization by vote 

of the holders of a majority of all the outstanding shares of stock of 

the Corporation entitled to vote thereon at the Corporation's Annual 

Meeting of Shareholders held on May 2, 1996.  Such amendment changed the  

number of shares of Common Stock which the Corporation has authority  

to issue from 200,000,000 shares, $.50 par value, of which 86,750,705  

shares are presently issued and outstanding, and 113,249,295 shares  

which are currently unissued at a rate of change of two to one, to  

400,000,000 shares, $.25 par value, of which 173,501,410 shares are  

presently issued and outstanding and 226,498,590 shares which are  

currently unissued at a rate of change of two to one. 

 

     4.  Article IIIB, which established a series of the Corpora- 

tion's authorized shares of Preferred Stock designated the ""$2.00 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



<PAGE 2> 

 

Preferred Equity-Redemption Cumulative Stock"", has been deleted in  

its entirety to reflect the complete redemption and cancellation by the  

Corporation of all such Preferred Stock. 

 

     5.  The text of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corpo- 

ration as heretofore amended is hereby restated to read as herein set  

forth in full:  

 

     ARTICLE I:     The corporate name is  

 

              AVON PRODUCTS, INC. 

 

     ARTICLE II:    The purposes for which the Corporation is  

formed are: 

 

     To develop, manufacture, produce, provide, operate, distribute 

     and deal in and with services, property and goods of all kinds 

     including without limitation engaging in the manufacture and 

     distribution of cosmetics and toiletries.  

 

     To engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may 

     be organized under the Business Corporation Law of the State of New 

     York.  

 

     ARTICLE III:  The total number of shares of all classes of capital 

stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 425,000,000 

shares, divided into two classes consisting of 400,000,000 shares of 

Common Stock, par value $.25 per share (the ""Common Stock""), and 

25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the  

""Preferred Stock""). 

 

     The shares of authorized Common Stock of the Corporation shall be 

identical in all respects and shall have equal rights and privileges. 

 

     The Board of Directors shall have authority by resolution to issue 

the shares of Preferred Stock from time to time on such terms as it may 

determine and to divide the Preferred Stock into one or more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



<PAGE 3> 

classes or series and, in connection with the creation of any such class  

or series, to determine and fix by the resolution or resolutions  

providing for the issuance of shares thereof the designation, powers  

and relative participating, optional, or other special rights of such 

class or series, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions 

thereof, to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by law. 

 

     The holders of capital stock of the Corporation shall not have any 

preemptive rights.  

 

     ARTICLE lllA.     Series A Junior Participating Preferred  

Stock:  

 

     1.  Designation and Amount.  An aggregate of 800,000 shares of 

Preferred Stock, par value $l.00, of the Corporation are hereby  

constituted as a series designated as ""Series A Junior Participating 

Preferred Stock"" (the ""Series A Preferred Stock"").  Such number  

of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of  

Directors; provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of  

shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of  

shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issu- 

ance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or  

upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corpo- 

ration convertible into Series A Preferred Stock. 

 

     2.  Dividends and Distributions. 

 

         (a)  Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of  

any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and  

superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the  

holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the  

holders of Common Stock, par value $0.25 per share (the ""Common  

Stock""), of the Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be  

entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors  

out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends pay- 

able in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December  

in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a ""Quarterly  

Dividend Payment Date""), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



<PAGE 4> 

Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share 

of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the  

nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $10 or (b) subject to the pro- 

vision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per  

share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per 

share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other 

distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock 

or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by  

reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the 

immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect 

to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance 

of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock.  In the  

event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on  

the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a  

subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares  

of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of  

a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number  

of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to  

which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled  

immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sen- 

tence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the  

numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock out- 

standing immediately after such event and the denominator of which is  

the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding imme- 

diately prior to such event.  

 

         (b)  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution 

on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of this 

Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the 

Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); 

provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been 

declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly 

Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment 

Date, a dividend of $l0 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall 

nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment 

Date. 

 



<PAGE 5>



         (c)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative  

on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly  

Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such  

shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record  

date for the  first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case  

dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue  

of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend  

Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of  

holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a  

quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,  

in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be  

cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but  

unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares  

of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of  

such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be  

allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at  

the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for  

the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock en- 

titled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared 

thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the 

date fixed for the payment thereof. 

 

     3.  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of Series A Preferred 

Stock shall have the following voting rights: 

 

         (a)  Subject to the provision for adjustment, hereinafter  

set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the 

holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the 

shareholders of the Corporation.  In the event the Corporation shall at 

any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in  

shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or  

consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassi- 

fication or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Com- 

mon Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common  

Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which  

holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately  

prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a  

fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common  



<PAGE 6>

Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator  

of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding 

immediately prior to such event. 



         (b)  Except as otherwise provided herein, in any Certificate 

of Amendment creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar  

stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and  

the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of  

the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one  

class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Corpo- 

ration.  

 

         (c)  Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided  

by law, holders of Series  A Preferred Stock shall have no voting 

rights. 

 

     4.  Certain Restrictions. 



         (a)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or 

distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears,  

thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions,  

whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock out- 

standing shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:  

 

           (i)  declare or pay dividends, or make any other

distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to divi-

dends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A  

Preferred Stock; 



            (ii)  declare or pay dividends, or make any other  

distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to  

dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the  

Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A  

Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable 

or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of 

all such shares are then entitled; 



            (iii)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for 

consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends  

or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A 

Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time  

redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock  

in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior  

(either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up)  

to the Series A Preferred Stock; or 



<PAGE 7>

 

           (iv)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for  

consideration shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock  

ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in  

accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as  

determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares  

upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the  

respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and prefer- 

ences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good 

faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective 

series or classes.  



           (b)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of  

the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any  

shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under  

this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time  

and in such manner. 

 

     5.  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series A Preferred  

Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner 

 whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition 

 thereof.  All such shares shall upon their cancellation become  

authorized but on issued shares of Preferred Stock and may be  

reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the  

conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the  

Certificate of Incorporation, in any other Certificate of Amendment  

creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as  

otherwise required by law. 



     6.  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.  Upon any liquidation, 

dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be 

made (i) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either  



<PAGE 8>



as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the  

Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of  

Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus an  

amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions  

thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided 

that the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be  

entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the pro- 

vision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the  

aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of  

Common Stock, or (ii) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a  

parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation , dissolution or  

winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions  

made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock  

in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such  

shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 

In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any 

dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or 

effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding 

shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment 

of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number  

of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate  

amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were  

entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (i)  

of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such  

amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares  

of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the  

denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that  

were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 



     7.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In case the Corporation  

shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other trans- 

action in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or  

changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property,  

then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at  

the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per  

share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth,  

equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash  

and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into  



<PAGE 9>



which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or  

exchanged.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or  

pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common  

Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the  

outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise  

than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a  

greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each  

such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect  

to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall  

be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of  

which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immedi- 

ately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of  

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to  

such event. 



     8.  Redemption.  The shares of Series A Preferred Stock  

shall not be redeemable. 

 

     9.  Rank.  The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with  

respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets,  

junior to all series of any other class of the Corporation's Preferred  

Stock. 

 

     10.  Amendment.  The Certificate of Incorporation of the 

Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially 

alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the  

Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the  

affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the 

outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a 

single series. 



     ARTICLE IV:  The office of the Corporation is to be located  

in the City and County of New York, State of New York. 

 

     ARTICLE V:  The number of directors of the Corporation shall be not 

less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20).  The number of directors 

to be chosen within said maximum and minimum limits shall be determined 

in the manner prescribed by the By-Laws. 



<PAGE 10>

     The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes as 

nearly equal in number as possible, with each class having at least  

three members, with the term of office of one class expiring each year.   

At the annual meeting of shareholders in 1986, directors of the first  

class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next 

succeeding annual meeting, directors of the second class shall be 

elected to hold office for a term expiring at the second succeeding 

annual meeting and directors of the third class shall be elected to hold 

office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting. 

 

     At each annual meeting of shareholders after 1986, successors to 

the directors whose terms shall then expire shall be elected to hold 

office for terms expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting.   

Any vacancies in the Board of Directors, by reason of an increase in the  

number of directors or otherwise, shall be filled solely by the Board of  

Directors, by majority vote of the directors then in office, though less  

than a quorum, but any such director so elected shall hold office only  

until the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders.  At such  

annual meeting, such director shall be elected and qualified in the 

class in which such director is assigned to hold office for the term or 

remainder of the term of such class.  Directors shall continue in office 

until others are chosen and qualified in their stead.  When the number 

of directors is changed, any newly created directorships or any decrease  

in directorships shall be so assigned among the classes by a majority  

of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, so as to  

make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible.  To the extent  

of any inequality within the limits of the foregoing, the class or 

classes caused to have the greatest or greater number of directorships 

shall be the class or classes then having the last date or the later 

dates for the expiration of its or their terms.  No decrease in the 

number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 

 

     Any director may be removed from office as a director but  

only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of eighty percent  

(80%) of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of  

stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of  

directors, voting together as a single class. 

 



<PAGE 11>



     Notwithstanding anything contained in this Restated Certificate of 

Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders  

of at least eighty percent (80%) of the combined voting power of the  

then outstanding shares of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote  

generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single 

class, shall be required to alter, amend or adopt any provisions 

inconsistent with or repeal this Article V. 

 

     The directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation. 



     ARTICLE VI:  At all elections of directors of the Corporation each 

shareholder shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number 

of votes which (except for the provisions of this Article) he would be 

entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his 

shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and  

he may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute  

them among the number to be voted for, or any two or more of them,  

as he may see fit. 

 

     ARTICLE VII: 

 

         (A)  In addition to any affirmative vote required by law or 

this Restated Certificate of Incorporation: 

 

     1.  any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any 

     Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) with (a) an Interested

     Shareholder (as hereinafter defined) or (b) any other corporation

     (whether or not itself an Interested Shareholder) which is, or

     after such merger or consolidation would be, an Affiliate (as 

     hereinafter defined) of an Interested Shareholder, or  

 

     2.  any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, grant of a 

     security interest, transfer or other disposition (in one 

     transaction or a series of transactions) to or with (a) an 

     Interested Shareholder or (b) an Affiliate of an Interested

     Shareholder of assets of the Corporation or any Subsidiary having

     an aggregate Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of 

     $25,000,000 or more, or  



<PAGE 12>



      3.  the issuance or transfer by the Corporation or any Subsidiary 

     (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of any securities

     of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, having an aggregate Fair

     Market Value of $25,000,000 or more to an Interested Shareholder or

     any Affiliate of an Interested Shareholder in exchange for cash,

     securities or other property (or combination thereof), or  



     4.  the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation  

     or dissolution of the Corporation proposed by or on behalf  

     of an Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate of an Interested  

     Shareholder, or  

 

     5.  any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock

     split), or recapitalization of the Corporation, or any merger or

     consolidation of the Corporation with any of its Subsidiaries or

     any other transaction (whether or not with or into or otherwise

     involving an Interested Shareholder) which has the effect, directly

     or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the

     outstanding shares of any class of equity or convertible securities

     of the Corporation or any Subsidiary directly or indirectly

     beneficially owned by (a) an Interested Shareholder or (b) an

     Affiliate of an Interested Shareholder 

 

shall require either:  

 

     (a)  the approval of a majority of the Disinterested Directors  

     (as hereinafter defined) or (b) the affirmative vote of the  

     holders of that amount of the voting power of the Voting  

     Stock (as hereinafter defined) equal to the sum of (1) the  

     voting power of the shares of Voting Stock of which their  

     Interested Shareholder is the beneficial owner and (2) a  

     majority of the voting power of the remaining outstanding  

     shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class;  

     provided, however, that no such vote shall be required for  

     the purchase by the Corporation of shares of Voting Stock  

     from an Interested Shareholder unless such vote is required  

     by Paragraph (B) of this Article VII.  

 



<PAGE 13>



     (B)  Any purchase by the Corporation of shares of Voting  

Stock from an Interested Shareholder, other than pursuant to an offer  

to the holders of all of the outstanding shares of the same class of  

Voting Stock as those so purchased, at a per share price in excess of  

the Market Price (as hereinafter defined), at the time of such purchase,  

of the shares so purchased, shall require the affirmative vote of the  

holders of that amount of the voting power of the Voting Stock equal to  

the sum of (i) the voting power of the shares of Voting Stock of which  

the Interested Shareholder is the beneficial owner (as hereinafter  

defined) and (ii) a majority of the voting power of the remaining out-

                                  ARTICLE SIX



     1.  Number, Election and Terms of Directors.  The business and affairs of

the Corporation shall be managed by a Board of Directors, which, subject to the

rights of holders of shares of any class of series of Preferred Stock of the

under specified circumstances, shall consist of not less than three nor more

the holders of 80% or more of the voting power of all of the shares of the

stockholders, the term of office of the second class to expire at the 1992

annual meeting of stockholders, and the term office of the third class to expire

at the 1993 annual meeting of stockholders, and with the members of each class

to hold office until their successors shall have been elected and qualified.  At

each annual meeting of stockholders following such initial classification and

election, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall

of stockholders after their election.

stockholder nominations for the election of directors shall be at least 120 days

the holders of any series of any Preferred Stock then outstanding, newly-created

directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors

and any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from the death,

resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause

may be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office even though

less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.



     4.  Removal.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of any

Preferred Stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board of Directors,

may be removed from office at any annual or special meeting called for such

purpose, and then only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders

of 80% or more of the voting power of all of the shares of the Corporation

entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a

single class.  As used herein, cause shall mean only the following:  proof,

beyond the existence of a reasonable doubt that a director has been convicted of

a felony, committed grossly negligent or wilful misconduct resulting in a

material detriment to the Corporation, or committed a material breach of his

fiduciary duty to the Corporation resulting in a material detriment to the

Corporation.

outstanding, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of

the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of

stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in

writing by such stockholders unless all of the stockholders entitled to vote

Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the

holders of 80% or more of the voting power of all the shares of the Corporation

entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a

single class, shall be required to call a special meeting of stockholders or to

alter, amend, or adopt any provision inconsistent with or repeal this Article

Seven, or to alter, amend, or adopt any provision inconsistent with comparable

sections of the Bylaws.



                                 ARTICLE EIGHT

vote required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the

Corporation, and except as otherwise expressly provided in paragraph 2 of this

Article Eight, a Business Combination (as hereinafter defined) shall be approved

          d. The term ""Interested Stockholder"" shall mean any person (other than

     the Corporation or any subsidiary and other than any profit-sharing,

     employee stock ownership, or other employee benefit plan of the Corporation

     or any subsidiary or any trustee of or fiduciary with respect to any such

     plan when acting in such capacity) who (i)  is the beneficial owner of

     Voting Stock representing twenty percent or more of the votes entitled to

     be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock; or

     (ii)  is an Affiliate or Associate of the Corporation and at any time

     within the two-year period immediately prior to the



                                       5

<PAGE>



     date in question was the beneficial owner of Voting Stock representing

     twenty percent or more of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of

     all the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock.



          e. A person shall be a ""beneficial owner"" of any Capital Stock (i)

     which such person or any of its Affiliates or Associates beneficially owns,

     directly or indirectly; (ii)  which such person or any of its Affiliates or

     Associates has, directly or indirectly, (A) the right to acquire (whether

     such right is exercisable immediately or subject only to the passage of

     time), pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding or upon the

     exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants, options, or

     otherwise, or (B) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement,

     or understanding; or (iii) which are beneficially owned, directly or

     indirectly, by any other person with which such person or any of its

     Affiliates or Associates has any agreement, arrangement, or understanding

     for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of

     Capital Stock.  For the purposes of determining whether a person is an

     Interested Stockholder pursuant to subparagraph (d) of this paragraph 3,

     the number of shares of Capital Stock deemed to be outstanding shall

     include shares deemed beneficially owned by such person through application

     of this subparagraph (e) of paragraph 3, but shall not include any other

     shares of Capital Stock that may be issuable pursuant to any agreement,

     arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion rights,

     warrants or options, or otherwise.



          f. The terms ""Affiliate"" and ""Associate"" shall have the respective

     meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange

     Act of 1934 as in effect on the date that Article Eight is approved by the

     Board (the term ""registrant"" in such Rule 12b-2 meaning, in this case, the

     Corporation.



          g. The term ""Subsidiary"" means any company of which a majority of any

     class of equity security is beneficially owned by the Corporation;

     provided, however, that for the purposes of the definition of Interested

     Stockholder set forth in subparagraph (d) of this paragraph 3, the term

     ""Subsidiary"" shall mean only a company of which a majority of each class of

     equity security is beneficially owned by the Corporation.



          h. The term ""Continuing Director"" means either (i)  any member of the

     Board of Directors, while such person is a member of the Board of

     Directors, who is not an Affiliate or Associate or representative of the

     Interested Stockholder and was a member of the Board of Directors prior to

     the time that the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder

     became an Interested Stockholder or (ii)  any member of the Board of

     Directors appointed as a director by the incorporator of the Corporation.

     The term ""Continuing Director"" shall also include any successor of a

     Continuing Director while such successor is a member of the Board of

     Directors, who is not an Affiliate or Associate or representative of the

     Interested Stockholder, and is recommended or elected to succeed the

     Continuing Director by a majority of Continuing Directors.



     4.  Determinations as to Status.  A majority of the Continuing Directors

shall have the power and duty to determine for the purposes of this Article

Eight, on the basis of information known to them after reasonable inquiry, (a)

whether a person is an Interested Stockholder, (b) the number of shares of

Capital Stock or other securities



                                       6

<PAGE>



beneficially owned by any person, (c) whether a person is an Affiliate or

Associate of another, and (d) whether the assets that are the subject of any

Business Combination have, or the consideration, to be received for the issuance

or transfer of securities by the Corporation of any subsidiary in any Business

Combination has, an aggregate fair market value of $1,000,000 or more. Any such

determination made in good faith shall be binding and conclusive on all parties.



     5.  Fiduciary Duty.  Nothing contained in this Article Eight shall be

construed to relieve any Interested Stockholder from any fiduciary obligation

imposed by law.



     6.  Determination by Board of Directors.  The fact that any Business

Combination complies with the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article Eight

shall not be construed to impose any fiduciary duty, obligation or

responsibility on the Board of Directors, or any member thereof, to approve such

Business Combination or recommend its adoption or approval to the stockholders

of the Corporation, nor shall such compliance limit, prohibit, or otherwise

restrict in any manner the Board of Directors, or any member thereof, with

respect to evaluations of or actions and responses taken with respect to

evaluations of or actions and responses taken with respect to such Business

Combination.



     7.  Effect of Business Combination.  Upon the earlier to occur of (i)  an

announcement by an Interested Stockholder of its intention to commence a

Business Combination, (ii)  the commencement by an Interested Stockholder of a

Business Combination; or (iii)  a person becoming an Interested Stockholder in

connection with a Business Combination, the number of directors constituting the

Board of Directors of the Corporation shall automatically be reduced to three,

consisting of one director from each class of directors; provided, however,

that, within fifteen days after the occurrence of such event, a majority of

Continuing Directors may from time to time suspend temporarily or permanently

the operation of this paragraph, and provided further, that no such reduction

shall shorten the term of any director then in office.



     8.  Amendments.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate

of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact

that a lesser percentage or separate class vote may be specified by law, this

Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation), the affirmative

vote of the holders of 80% or more of the votes entitled to be cast by the

holders of all the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a

single class, shall be required to alter, amend, repeal, or adopt any provision

inconsistent with this Article Eight.



                                  ARTICLE NINE



     The Corporation shall have the power to indemnify its current or former

directors, officers, employees and agents or any person who served or is serving

at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise to

the full extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.  Such

indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which such

person may be entitled, under any bylaws, agreements, vote of stockholders or

disinterested directors, or otherwise.

ARTICLE FIVE



The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.



ARTICLE SIX



Elections of Directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the

Corporation shall so provide.



ARTICLE SEVEN



The number of directors which constitute the entire Board of Directors of the

Corporation shall be designated in the Bylaws of the Corporation.



ARTICLE EIGHT



In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the

Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the

Bylaws of the Corporation.



ARTICLE NINE



Section 1. Limitation of Liability.



(a) To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as

it now exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such

amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to

provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), and

except as otherwise provided in the Corporations Bylaws, no Director or

officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its

stockholders for monetary damages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty owed

to the Corporation or its stockholders.



(b) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders

of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a

Director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or

modification.



Section 2. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or

is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including

involvement as a witness) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,

criminal, administrative or investigative (a proceeding), by reason of the

fact that he or she is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation or,

while a Director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the

request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of

another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other

enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an

indemnitee), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an

official capacity as a Director or officer or in any other capacity while

serving as a Director or officer or in any other



3



* * *



capacity while serving as a Director or officer or in any other capacity while

serving as a Director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by

the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General

Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, the case

of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the

Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior

thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees,

judgments, fines, taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement)

reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and

such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a

Director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the

indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that,

except as provided in Section 3 of this ARTICLE NINE with respect to

proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall

indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part

thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part

thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The

right to indemnification conferred in this Section 2 of this ARTICLE NINE

shall be a contract right and shall include the obligation of the Corporation

to pay the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of

its final disposition (an advance of expenses); provided, however, that, if

and to the extent that the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an

advance of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a

Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is

rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an

employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of

an undertaking (an undertaking), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to

repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final

judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (a final

adjudication) that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such

expenses under this Section 2 or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of

its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the

Corporation with the same or lesser scope and effect as the foregoing

indemnification of Directors and officers.



Section 3. Procedure for Indemnification. Any indemnification of a Director or

officer of the Corporation or advance of expenses under Section 2 of this

ARTICLE NINE shall be made promptly, and in any event within forty-five days

(or, in the case of an advance of expenses, twenty days), upon the written

request of the Director or officer. If a determination by the Corporation that

the Director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this

ARTICLE NINE is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty

days to a written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to

have approved the request. If the Corporation denies a written request for

indemnification or advance of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in

full pursuant to such request is not made within forty-five days (or, in the

case of an advance of expenses, twenty days), the right to indemnification or

advances as granted by this ARTICLE NINE shall be enforceable by the Director

or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such persons costs and

expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her

right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also

be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action



4



* * *



(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of expenses

where the undertaking required pursuant to Section 2 of this ARTICLE NINE, if

any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the

standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General

Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount

claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither

the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent

legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the

commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in

the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct

set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination

by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal

counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable

standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption

that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The

procedure for indemnification of other employees and agents for whom

indemnification is provided pursuant to Section 2 of this ARTICLE NINE shall

be the same procedure set forth in this Section 3 for Directors or officers,

unless otherwise set forth in the action of the Board of Directors providing

indemnification for such employee or agent.



Section 4. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on

its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer,

employee or agent of the Corporation or was serving at the request of the

Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,

partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense,

liability or loss asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in

any such capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to

indemnify such person against such expenses, liability or loss under the

Delaware General Corporation Law.



Section 5. Service for Subsidiaries. Any person serving as a Director,

officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited

liability company, joint venture, or other enterprise, at least fifty percent

(50%) of whose equity interests are owned by the Corporation (a subsidiary

for this ARTICLE NINE) shall be conclusively presumed to be serving in such

capacity at the request of the Corporation.



Section 6. Reliance. Persons who after the date of the adoption of this

provision become or remain Directors or officers of the Corporation or who,

while a Director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a Director,

officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to

have relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights

contained in this ARTICLE NINE in entering into or continuing such service.

The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this

ARTICLE NINE shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of

acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the

adoption hereof.



5



* * *



Section 7. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the

advance of expenses conferred in this ARTICLE NINE shall not be exclusive of

any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this

Certificate or under any statute, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or

disinterested Directors or otherwise.



Section 8. Merger or Consolidation. For purposes of this ARTICLE NINE,

references to the Corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting

Corporation, any constituent Corporation (including any constituent of a

constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate

existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its

Directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was

a Director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent Corporation, or is

or was serving at the request of such constituent Corporation as a Directors,

officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture,

trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this ARTICLE

NINE with respect to the resulting or surviving Corporation as he or she would

have with respect to such constituent Corporation if its separate existence

had continued.



ARTICLE TEN



Section 1. Election of Directors. At each annual meeting of stockholders,

directors of the Corporation shall be elected to hold office until the

expiration of the term for which they are elected, and until their successors

have been duly elected and qualified; except that if any such election shall

be not so held, such election shall take place at stockholders meeting called

and held in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law.



Section 2. Vacancies. Vacancies occurring on the Board of Directors for any

reason may be filed by vote of a majority of the remaining members of the

Board of Directors, although less than a quorum, at any meeting of the Board

of Directors. A person so elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy

shall hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders of

the Corporation and until his or successor shall have been duly elected and

qualified.



ARTICLE ELEVEN



Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware,

as the Bylaws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject

to any provision contained in the statutes) outside of the State of Delaware

at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of

Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.



6



* * *



ARTICLE TWELVE



The stockholders of the Corporation may not take any action by written consent

in lieu of a meeting, and must take any actions at a duly called annual or

special meeting of stockholders and the power of stockholders to consent in

writing without a meeting is specifically denied. Special meetings of

stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by either the Board of

Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of the

majority of the total number of directors then in office or a holder of or

holders of at least ten percent of all outstanding shares of Common Stock. Any

action that may be taken at a regular meeting of stockholders may also be

taken at any special meeting of stockholders.



ARTICLE THIRTEEN



Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate or any provision of

law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to

any affirmative vote of the holders of the capital stock required by law or

this Certificate, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority

of the combined voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the

Corporation eligible to be cast in the election of directors shall be required

to alter, amend or repeal ARTICLES FOUR or NINE hereof, or this ARTICLE

THIRTEEN, or any provision thereof or hereof.



ARTICLE FOURTEEN



The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any

provision contained in this Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter

prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are

granted subject to this reservation.



ARTICLE FIFTEEN



The Corporation shall not issue any class of non-voting equity securities

unless and solely to the extent permitted by Section 1123(a)(6) of the United

States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) as in effect on the date of

filing this Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware;

provided, however, that this ARTICLE FIFTEEN: (a) will have no further force

and effect beyond that required under Section 1123(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy

Code; (b) will have such force and effect, if any, only for so long as Section

1123(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code is in effect and applicable to the

Corporation; and (c) in all events may be amended or eliminated in accordance

with applicable law from time to time in effect.
